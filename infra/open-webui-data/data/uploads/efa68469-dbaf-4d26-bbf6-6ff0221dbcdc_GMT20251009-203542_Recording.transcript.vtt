00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.319
Amith Kozhipuram: That's the test file.

2
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:18.299
Amith Kozhipuram: And… I'm sending over the… Latest component library as well.

3
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:36.370
Amith Kozhipuram: I've attached it to the, test file, Louise, in case you want to reach into the, reach the banner through the assets panel, you could do that, or you could copy-paste from this library how your, workflow

4
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.210
Amith Kozhipuram: Okay.

5
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:49.430
Luis Gallo: Okay, so I have the first link, that's the test file, so, I just requested access from you. It's opening now, it's opening, it's in my Figma, my desktop, so that's… that's great.

6
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:59.299
Luis Gallo: I got… so I'm opening the other Figma right now, the library right now, and that's also open in my Figma desktop, so that's good.

7
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.920
Luis Gallo: So, okay, so, create a banner for the homepage.

8
00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.429
Amith Kozhipuram: Oh, sorry, Luis, could you share your screen, so…

9
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.410
Luis Gallo: Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, sorry,

10
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.929
Luis Gallo: You did say that about before. This is…

11
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.030
Luis Gallo: This is what I see right here.

12
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.430
Luis Gallo: Okay.

13
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.579
Luis Gallo: So, read the updated documentation as needed, all your existing workflow to build a banner.

14
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.779
Luis Gallo: Okay, so, there's nothing else on… on… in this Figma, is there?

15
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.720
Amith Kozhipuram: No, there's nothing else.

16
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.880
Luis Gallo: Okay, cool. So… so do you want me to go, like, to go reference, like, for example,

17
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.990
Luis Gallo: like, a homepage that I'm currently working on right now, like, for example, like, can you see this? Like, the Halloween? Yeah, y'all can see this?

18
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.540
Amith Kozhipuram: Yep.

19
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.630
Luis Gallo: So…

20
00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.509
Luis Gallo: Yeah, so this is basically kind of, like, my day-to-day banners that I, kind of work from, so,

21
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:11.260
Luis Gallo: you know, the way, if I wanted to kind of, like, rebuild this, like, I, you know, what I would do is I would come in here, so we have, you know.

22
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:28.999
Luis Gallo: all the templates are laid out here, like, in our Figma file, like, in the homepage, design file, we have another, tab here on the left. It just says templates, and that has all the latest, the latest components that we use, like, on a regular basis, kind of laid out in our current workflow.

23
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.279
Luis Gallo: And so we have,

24
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:43.939
Luis Gallo: So, like, when I start a new week, I'll typically come over here, and I'll grab the parts that I need. So this is what I'm going to be using. So I bring it over here to the correct week. This is P13 on week 5.

25
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.920
Luis Gallo: So I lay it in… in here.

26
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.549
Luis Gallo: So typically, I would… you know, I would start from,

27
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.549
Luis Gallo: the component, so I would grab this piece.

28
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.159
Luis Gallo: You know, we would, have it here, and then we would just kind of start… oh, sorry, hold on.

29
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:18.320
Luis Gallo: we would start just basically filling in all, like, all the spaces, right? So this is the above-the-fold grid, the hero grid that we use, and so I would just basically start to, yeah, to just build it, right? So I come over here, and these are already…

30
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.809
Luis Gallo: These are components, so I'll have to detach them so I can work with them.

31
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.829
Amith Kozhipuram: Right? So I have to come in here, and I have to…

32
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.779
Luis Gallo: Like, the whole thing.

33
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.850
Luis Gallo: Yeah, go ahead.

34
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.400
Brian Monzingo: I'm sorry to interrupt. Hi, this is Brian. I'll turn my camera on so it's not weird. Well, it's still weird, I'm in my car.

35
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.750
Luis Gallo: It's kind of weird, it's kind of weird, man, not gonna lie.

36
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.820
Brian Monzingo: Thank you for, for showing us,

37
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.240
Brian Monzingo: What your work, space is like.

38
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.589
Brian Monzingo: I… I… and I'm sorry if…

39
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.539
Brian Monzingo: This wasn't clear from Amit's instructions, or if you were getting there, but…

40
00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:01.590
Brian Monzingo: What we would love to see you do is use the new banner component that we created, And…

41
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.400
Brian Monzingo: And design a banner.

42
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:13.680
Brian Monzingo: Like, using maybe some of the assets that you already have, but see if you can use the… if the new component, like, treats you better than the… than the old, or the current.

43
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.090
Luis Gallo: Where is… is the new component that you're speaking of, is it in this other usability test, WebCX?

44
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.870
Luis Gallo: file, or, like, where do I get to this new banner?

45
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.840
Brian Monzingo: It is.

46
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.620
Amith Kozhipuram: Yeah, this is the new component, luis, too.

47
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:44.029
Amith Kozhipuram: Looking at some examples and documentation, we have the main component in there as well, and some sticker sheet that you can copy instances off of.

48
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:52.150
Luis Gallo: So these are the compo- these are the new components right here. So these are the components you want me to mess around with. Nice! Okay, alright, well…

49
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.809
Luis Gallo: I'm gonna go… I'm gonna go big, so I can pick any of these, right? I can pick any of them?

50
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.959
Amith Kozhipuram: Alright, well then I'm just gonna pick…

51
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.960
Luis Gallo: We'll wait. This guy.

52
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.620
Brian Monzingo: I have a caveat.

53
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.150
Luis Gallo: Okay, go for it.

54
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.750
Brian Monzingo: Because, those are custom, custom height.

55
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.000
Luis Gallo: Okay, okay.

56
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.899
Brian Monzingo: I think we'd really… we'd really be interested to know if there's a, if there's, like, a height that you use that isn't custom.

57
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.610
Brian Monzingo: Like, so…

58
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.490
Luis Gallo: Yeah.

59
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.100
Brian Monzingo: If… if one of the top… one of the top ones that's not in the custom area, yeah.

60
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.730
Luis Gallo: Yeah, so I guess this would probably be… this is 300 pixels. I think this would be a good one to work with. This is…

61
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.290
Luis Gallo: standard. I'm gonna snag this one… You want me to do all the banners, all three versions, or just one?

62
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.100
Amith Kozhipuram: You could start with one, Louise, and if you feel like messing around with the rest.

63
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.810
Luis Gallo: Yeah.

64
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.610
Amith Kozhipuram: Minnesota?

65
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.050
Luis Gallo: Yeah, yeah, no, I feel like,

66
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.300
Luis Gallo: Yes, I could definitely do that. I'm like…

67
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:05.690
Luis Gallo: Let me see… I'm gonna bring it in over here, and so these are banners, you know, we'll pretend like they love my Halloween banner so much.

68
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:14.929
Luis Gallo: and they want to, they want to put it in other placements on the website, so I'm gonna use these banners to build these new things, right? And so.

69
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:24.299
Luis Gallo: So I see this is a component, so I'm gonna detach it. So that's how I always work. So I always detach the instance so I can edit it.

70
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:33.080
Luis Gallo: I learned to check and see if it… so I see that the clip content isn't selected, so I'm gonna select that.

71
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:43.270
Luis Gallo: And I'm gonna do that to all of them. So I detach the instance on all of them, and I do clip content for everything, so I can just kind of move quickly.

72
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.030
Luis Gallo: And then…

73
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:57.609
Luis Gallo: So I'm gonna take these assets. So, like, normally, like, in a lot of cases, you know, we pull from things that were already shot, and these are all assets that I shoot in a studio, but these are things, you know, that have already been laid out. So I'm gonna resize this.

74
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.790
Luis Gallo: And… in these new components.

75
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.629
Luis Gallo: Let me just select all the…

76
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.440
Luis Gallo: this stuff. I'm sure there's probably, like, a…

77
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.159
Luis Gallo: a better way to select all these things, but I'm just like…

78
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.079
Luis Gallo: Being watched right now, and it's a little awkward, so…

79
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.390
Amith Kozhipuram: So…

80
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.510
Luis Gallo: Yeah.

81
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.990
Luis Gallo: What I should… yeah, so…

82
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.970
Luis Gallo: So I come in here, and then,

83
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.470
Luis Gallo: So I check the, the layers over here, and I see, okay, where do I…

84
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:33.770
Luis Gallo: want to sort of place this. I see you have an image export area, so you'd want to kind of lay it out, like, in… in there, but I see…

85
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:45.040
Luis Gallo: everything seems to be, like, stacking and doing some weird… some weirdness in there, so I don't know if it has something to do with, like, the settings of alignment or, like, cont… or, like, the way that the…

86
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.590
Luis Gallo: Because, like, if I'm pasting it, so, like, it should just, like…

87
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:58.309
Luis Gallo: just paste like this, right? It should all stay intact, but when I put it in there, it seems like it wants to, like, stack.

88
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.259
Luis Gallo: So I… So I see that.

89
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:10.369
Amith Kozhipuram: So we've got some nested components in there, and we've tried to place instructions in the layer naming.

90
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:19.629
Amith Kozhipuram: So if you look at the image container layer inside the banner component, if you scroll up a little bit.

91
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.870
Amith Kozhipuram: So you would need to detach this particular layer.

92
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.869
Luis Gallo: Oh, I see. I see it now. Oh, I see.

93
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:28.989
Amith Kozhipuram: I see, I see.

94
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.009
Amith Kozhipuram: Right. Oh, sorry, one second.

95
00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.139
Luis Gallo: Yeah, that makes sense.

96
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.779
Amith Kozhipuram: Yep, so we've got the clip, content.

97
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.610
Amith Kozhipuram: Inside this, nested component, basically, so…

98
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:48.039
Amith Kozhipuram: You won't need to turn on the clip content on the main parent component anymore.

99
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.170
Luis Gallo: Awesome. Okay.

100
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.930
Amith Kozhipuram: Right.

101
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:56.080
Luis Gallo: So… does this… alright, so you guys can still see my screen, okay, and let me zoom…

102
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.469
Luis Gallo: Is everybody good?

103
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.219
Amith Kozhipuram: Yep, yep, we can see it.

104
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:06.769
Luis Gallo: Okay, cool. Yeah, so… so that… that's… I mean, that's kind of it, you know? That's kind of, like…

105
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:12.380
Luis Gallo: it, for there. I mean, and then, like, we would, you know, export

106
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:18.770
Luis Gallo: So I guess there's, a layer here, I think you said it, there was a… Hold on.

107
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:28.779
Luis Gallo: I'm all over the place. Export image. So we would have to export this layer, image export. So we would name this layer and export this.

108
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:35.650
Luis Gallo: And that wouldn't include the copy. The copy is not, isn't part of that.

109
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:43.039
Luis Gallo: Yeah, so… so we would just, you know, and then… and do the same thing on the other ones, I mean, you just…

110
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.509
Luis Gallo: Come over here and do, like, what you said.

111
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.770
Luis Gallo: So I'll select the banner, image container.

112
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.560
Luis Gallo: So detach that guy, throw in the new stuff… oh, I should've did it again, hold on.

113
00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.799
Luis Gallo: Image… artwork? Yeah, so there we go. So I threw it in there.

114
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:07.800
Luis Gallo: want to resize it a little bit? It's already kind of laid out, so you just want to resize it, and there's your…

115
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.659
Luis Gallo: Tablet version of… of, this guy.

116
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:12.920
Amith Kozhipuram: Okay.

117
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:21.530
Luis Gallo: And they would get a copy, like, usually the copywriter will go in there, and they'll, like, they'll mess with the copy. They're… they're writing the copy in there directly, so I don't really mess with that.

118
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.850
Luis Gallo: Okay.

119
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:28.070
Luis Gallo: And then, just, you know, just last stack, I'll just do this one.

120
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.700
Luis Gallo: Do you guys have… you know.

121
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:40.910
Luis Gallo: Plenty of content to… Make fun of, and stuff over there, and… Alright.

122
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.769
Luis Gallo: I don't know, where is it, where is it?

123
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.980
Luis Gallo: Is it this one? Oh, it was this one. This one, right?

124
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.870
Luis Gallo: Image container… that… Why am I not able to detach that?

125
00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.430
Amith Kozhipuram: Oh, it's already attached, I believe.

126
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:03.369
Luis Gallo: Oh, it's already detached? Oh, yeah, but it's… but it's doing that thing again, where it's, like, wrapping everything.

127
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:09.140
Amith Kozhipuram: Yeah, you need to select the image artwork layer.

128
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.669
Luis Gallo: Image Artwork Layer.

129
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:18.460
Luis Gallo: I see image container, I see appearance, I see… image artwork.

130
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.729
Amith Kozhipuram: There it is.

131
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.940
Luis Gallo: Damn, look at that.

132
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.850
Luis Gallo: Awesome. So yeah, man, that… that's…

133
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.130
Luis Gallo: I mean, that's pretty fast. That's pretty quick, you know? That's pretty easy. I mean…

134
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.210
Luis Gallo: I don't see any issues with that.

135
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:46.889
Amith Kozhipuram: Alright, so we've also put in some properties into the text component, so that the text block itself is a different nested component, and you can mess around with the properties.

136
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:59.399
Amith Kozhipuram: on the whole, as a text block, you could have it left-aligned, right-aligned, or central aligned. We have… we have all that documentation instructions in that usability test file.

137
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.009
Luis Gallo: Nice, nice, I see that. So you kind of have, like, the one…

138
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.340
Luis Gallo: the one solve for everything. It's like the ultimate… the ultimate component here.

139
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.910
Amith Kozhipuram: Ultimate.

140
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.410
Luis Gallo: every…

141
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:10.220
Amith Kozhipuram: Ultimate…

142
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.560
Luis Gallo: Every banner, every size, every height, every width.

143
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.909
Amith Kozhipuram: Drop shadow, no drop shadow…

144
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.430
Luis Gallo: Rounded, copyright color, light, dark.

145
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.600
Luis Gallo: Copyright, vertical alignment, you know, 10%.

146
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.280
Luis Gallo: 30%.

147
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:31.360
Luis Gallo: Center, show logo, not… oh, damn, the logos.

148
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.229
Luis Gallo: But that's… that's a big deal for me. That's great.

149
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.910
Luis Gallo: You have the button, you have…

150
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.219
Luis Gallo: You can pull in logos if you want, I guess, choose the instant, select a logo.

151
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:51.960
Luis Gallo: You have the color, you have the breakpoints, So you can go… Right? Wait.

152
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.699
Amith Kozhipuram: Why didn't that move?

153
00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:01.169
Amith Kozhipuram: Oh, so that particular breakpoint drop-down is not something we need to edit.

154
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:01.910
Luis Gallo: Okay.

155
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.499
Amith Kozhipuram: It gets modified.

156
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.319
Amith Kozhipuram: Okay. When you select the parent breakpoint.

157
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.280
Luis Gallo: the one.

158
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.720
Brian Monzingo: The big one up at the top.

159
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.300
Amith Kozhipuram: Yep.

160
00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.920
Luis Gallo: Oh, oh, up here, got it. Oh, I see what you're saying. Oh, dang!

161
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.190
Amith Kozhipuram: text as well.

162
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.659
Luis Gallo: Damn, damn… who made these?

163
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.830
Amith Kozhipuram: Brian, maybe, so…

164
00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.499
Luis Gallo: Brian, in your car, did you make these in your car, too?

165
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:37.059
Brian Monzingo: I've made them in my car, I've made them in the park, I've made them in my daughter's room, like, I can make them anywhere.

166
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.969
Luis Gallo: Dude, that's like the new Dr. Seuss book right there, like.

167
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.700
Brian Monzingo: Yeah.

168
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:43.939
Luis Gallo: Yeah, it's like green eggs and ham.

169
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.310
Brian Monzingo: You gotta make, like.

170
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.690
Luis Gallo: Terror.

171
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:46.610
Brian Monzingo: mouse?

172
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:51.400
Luis Gallo: Yeah, I'll… yeah, yeah, I, I, you can tell I have a kid, so…

173
00:13:51.600 --> 00:14:01.449
Luis Gallo: Small… yeah, dude, this is great. I, I, I love it. I was looking at… alright, so let's see, desktop…

174
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:09.189
Luis Gallo: 400… you guys, do you say that the copy can go to the right? Like, it can go right-aligned, or is it just centered or left?

175
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:16.480
Amith Kozhipuram: I believe it goes right along. Let me quickly check… oh, it does not go right aligned.

176
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.830
Luis Gallo: It does, right? Okay, okay. Well… I mean…

177
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:32.570
Luis Gallo: Yeah, in terms of, like, is it easy to use? Does it make sense? All of those things, I think it checks all those boxes. I don't see any issues. I think the way you have everything, labeled.

178
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.000
Luis Gallo: Here to the left, like, the layers themselves.

179
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.749
Luis Gallo: They're pretty… that's pretty solid,

180
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.739
Luis Gallo: I mean, you have, like, you know, drop shadow, you have the image container.

181
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.899
Amith Kozhipuram: And then it's giving you instructions to, like, detach the layer, you…

182
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:55.669
Luis Gallo: You want to do that. You have the appearance, you have the image export, you know, insert artwork. It seems like it's pretty, pretty straightforward, to me.

183
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.989
Amith Kozhipuram: Awesome, awesome. Thanks for walking us through that.

184
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:07.069
Amith Kozhipuram: Around the components themselves, I don't have any more questions.

185
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.579
Amith Kozhipuram: Alan or Brian, Did you guys wanna…

186
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.799
Amith Kozhipuram: have Louise look at something else while we're here.

187
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.160
Amith Kozhipuram: Before we move on to the documentation for a quick bit.

188
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:27.430
Alan Carolino: Not anything, any particular, task request for me. Brian, I'll leave it to you, but,

189
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:37.220
Alan Carolino: Luis, I just wanted to add just a little bit of… not to affect the test at all, but, like, to give a little context that I've been working with our contractors to rebuild and clean up

190
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:53.460
Alan Carolino: our components, our harvest components, so nothing will be changed, it should all just be cleaned up. So, we're hoping to see that, like, it all is familiar to you, and everything makes sense, like, as far as, like, functionality and all the things that you…

191
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:59.540
Alan Carolino: All the alignments and modifications that you expect to see are in there. So, nothing is…

192
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:07.810
Alan Carolino: changing with banners at all, it's all just being cleaned up into place. Hopefully, it's, usable for all our teams, not just… not just you and me, but just for everybody.

193
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:14.529
Luis Gallo: Yeah, no, I think this is… is… is great. I think it's… definitely, you see everything on the right, it just makes…

194
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.160
Luis Gallo: It, definitely feels easier, to me.

195
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:19.839
Luis Gallo: The way you have it laid out.

196
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:21.460
Amith Kozhipuram: Awesome.

197
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.690
Brian Monzingo: That's really… that's really cool to hear.

198
00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.260
Brian Monzingo: Luis, there is one thing that I would…

199
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:36.390
Brian Monzingo: just love to see if it works. And that is… sometimes… After doing a layout.

200
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.580
Brian Monzingo: When viewing the content live.

201
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:47.420
Brian Monzingo: the, it, like… It could run into the text if it gets scaled to a smaller.

202
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:47.790
Luis Gallo: or something.

203
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:48.620
Brian Monzingo: eyes.

204
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:54.070
Brian Monzingo: And I'm… I'm wondering how you might use this component to,

205
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.459
Brian Monzingo: To test that, like, if you had a headline in there, just to make sure that

206
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:05.099
Brian Monzingo: It didn't overrun, and I'm going to give you…

207
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:15.329
Brian Monzingo: But I'm gonna give you a cheat, and that is in the documentation, I won't make you read it, but if you select all of the images from your.

208
00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:15.889
Luis Gallo: H.

209
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.500
Brian Monzingo: image artwork.

210
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:26.869
Brian Monzingo: And… and set the property, the layout property to scale, you know, over on the right side, where underneath where it says mixed, if you go scale, scale.

211
00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:27.990
Brian Monzingo: goes…

212
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.680
Luis Gallo: Up by the crosshairs on the left side.

213
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.739
Brian Monzingo: Yeah, where it says top, if you change that to scale.

214
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.759
Brian Monzingo: And then the other one above it, it doesn't have anything in it, but if you change that to scale…

215
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:51.209
Brian Monzingo: Okay, okay. And then… and then the container of all of them. Is image… is group or image artwork, are those also set the same way?

216
00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.070
Brian Monzingo: Image Artwork and group.

217
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.200
Luis Gallo: Yes, yes, image artwork, that's…

218
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.049
Brian Monzingo: Can that one… can… will that one change?

219
00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:09.410
Luis Gallo: Scale… scale… oh, it's like when I do scale to 1, it changes the other one to center, it's weird.

220
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.299
Brian Monzingo: just ungroup it, and I think it'll be fine.

221
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.060
Luis Gallo: Okay.

222
00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:14.850
Brian Monzingo: Oops.

223
00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.220
Luis Gallo: Oh, no, I just double grouped it.

224
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.499
Luis Gallo: Sorry. Okay. Alright, I see what you're saying.

225
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.500
Brian Monzingo: Now I think you're good.

226
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.030
Luis Gallo: Nope.

227
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.060
Brian Monzingo: This was gone.

228
00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.130
Luis Gallo: Oh, let me see… Scale.

229
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:29.710
Brian Monzingo: Oh, will it?

230
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:34.419
Luis Gallo: Seems like it's… it's doing that again. It's like it's… it's kind of like whack-a-mole right now.

231
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:45.570
Brian Monzingo: Oh, okay, this is good, because I need to fix the component, but you can help me on your end. If you scroll up to the top, and click the image export, Insert Artwork.

232
00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:47.080
Brian Monzingo: thing.

233
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.070
Luis Gallo: Later.

234
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.800
Brian Monzingo: The layer on the.

235
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.650
Luis Gallo: Yes, yes, got it.

236
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.219
Brian Monzingo: That says scale and scale, and then the one above it?

237
00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.060
Luis Gallo: It doesn't say anything.

238
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.869
Brian Monzingo: Fine, okay, now let's get… now try to scale the whole banner and see if it works.

239
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.090
Luis Gallo: Oh, let me make sure I'm selecting everything.

240
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.159
Brian Monzingo: Okay, that's what it's supposed to owe, almost.

241
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.600
Luis Gallo: Almost, almost. It's moving a little bit, it's moving.

242
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.940
Brian Monzingo: Got some work to do.

243
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.859
Luis Gallo: Oh, I see what you're doing.

244
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.760
Luis Gallo: Yeah.

245
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:38.239
Luis Gallo: Yeah, because I think what happens, like, there's a rule, right? Alan and their team are like, well, you know, always use 50% of the banner, but sometimes the copy's really small. So sometimes you have a little bit of more space, and it just looks silly if there's this big…

246
00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.579
Luis Gallo: You know, empty area, you know,

247
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.890
Luis Gallo: So I think, having that… Breakpoint, check.

248
00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.090
Luis Gallo: you know, I think would be helpful.

249
00:19:50.830 --> 00:20:05.640
Brian Monzingo: Thank you for humoring me on the scaling. That's something that's really important for quality assurance, you know, to make sure that it all scales right, and we want the tool to work for you so that you're not having to fidget with the controls.

250
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.580
Luis Gallo: For sure.

251
00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.640
Brian Monzingo: That was my one thing that I wanted to see. Thank you.

252
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.529
Luis Gallo: Yeah, yeah, man, and then…

253
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:17.770
Luis Gallo: So I would take this banner, and I would, you know, just put it over here at the bottom of our…

254
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.030
Luis Gallo: Yeah, it would live, you know, somewhere like that.

255
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:24.750
Amith Kozhipuram: Awesome.

256
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.100
Amith Kozhipuram: Nice.

257
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:32.400
Amith Kozhipuram: Thanks for walking us through your workflow with this new component.

258
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:40.489
Amith Kozhipuram: I think with the usability test, that's all we had. Yihan, did you have anything for Louise?

259
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.450
Yi Han: Hi, Luis. Thank you so.

260
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.260
Luis Gallo: Hi, yee, huh?

261
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:53.480
Yi Han: being us, I have one question, like, how confident are you to handle the work with these new components?

262
00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:01.650
Luis Gallo: To hand this work over to somebody else, like, if I were to say, hey, go make this, I feel like if…

263
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:16.309
Luis Gallo: you know, I would definitely want to walk them through it a little bit. I think if they were to come in… so, I haven't looked at the documentation, but I feel like the documentation, from what I saw, looked pretty good, as long as those layers are called out.

264
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.009
Luis Gallo: you know, I think most people,

265
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:27.339
Luis Gallo: that work in Figma, I guess, understand the layers and stuff, so I think that's not a problem. But there's always a chance that somebody that doesn't have a lot of experience

266
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:34.890
Luis Gallo: you know, could go in there and might not understand, like, the layers. So, like, as long as that documentation is here in the,

267
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.629
Luis Gallo: you know, the Figma, then I think you should be, oh, you know.

268
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.619
Luis Gallo: I think we should be okay.

269
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.879
Yi Han: Gothic. Thank you.

270
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.230
Luis Gallo: Forrest.

271
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.420
Luis Gallo: Awesome, alright.

272
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:49.680
Amith Kozhipuram: Yes.

273
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.720
Luis Gallo: Anything else?

274
00:21:51.990 --> 00:22:01.030
Amith Kozhipuram: I don't think so. That was it. And, just to highlight, we have all the instructions for,

275
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.059
Amith Kozhipuram: How to use this banner in the documentation.

276
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:06.950
Luis Gallo: Okay.

277
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:14.890
Amith Kozhipuram: And, if you zoom out, I think… The UX guidelines.

278
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:20.889
Amith Kozhipuram: And the last section… oh, the third vertical row.

279
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.340
Luis Gallo: Third vertical roll, right here.

280
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.760
Luis Gallo: Oh, right here, okay, it's all… Oh, right here.

281
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:31.910
Amith Kozhipuram: Yep, and all the way to the bottom, we have… I see it.

282
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.350
Amith Kozhipuram: specific instructions.

283
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.959
Amith Kozhipuram: So yeah, just wanted to call that out.

284
00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.649
Luis Gallo: Awesome. Awesome. Yeah, I think this is,

285
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.950
Luis Gallo: This is very well done, very clean.

286
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:47.809
Luis Gallo: Very simple.

287
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:53.430
Luis Gallo: It looks really good. Man, I feel like this is, like, I'm, like, the ultimate rule breaker right here for this.

288
00:22:54.650 --> 00:23:00.640
Luis Gallo: but… but yeah, no, I think this looks great, though, guys. Like, y'all did a good job.

289
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.349
Amith Kozhipuram: Awesome. Glad you're here.

290
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.100
Luis Gallo: Yeah, for sure. Alright, well…

291
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:06.550
Amith Kozhipuram: Mate.

292
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.920
Luis Gallo: What else? What else you need?

293
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:18.940
Amith Kozhipuram: That was all. I… unless you want to mess around with some other component, we have most of the… actually, all of the harvest components ready to go.

294
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:26.610
Amith Kozhipuram: So… If you want to mess around with any other component, you could do that. Otherwise,

295
00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:34.439
Amith Kozhipuram: Banner was the main one we wanted to run by you, and… Check, how you felt about it?

296
00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:48.160
Luis Gallo: Yeah, no, I feel pretty good. So this is an example of, like, the scaling, like, if you go from, like, a small iPhone to, like, a big iPhone, it's gonna scale the imagery, but the copy's gonna stay the same size.

297
00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:50.700
Brian Monzingo: That's.

298
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.290
Amith Kozhipuram: Nope.

299
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.920
Luis Gallo: Okay, got it, okay.

300
00:23:52.920 --> 00:24:01.930
Brian Monzingo: And those… those are your eyeballs watching the text, and the pictures, and the button to make sure they don't run into each other.

301
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.179
Brian Monzingo: I bought… that I bought.

302
00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:06.550
Luis Gallo: Oh.

303
00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:10.400
Brian Monzingo: Those are… those are your eyeballs. Those are all of our eyeballs.

304
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.259
Luis Gallo: Oh, oh, I see. Okay, I was like…

305
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.270
Luis Gallo: Yeah, that was a little weird there for a second, but I see what you're saying now, okay.

306
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:24.040
Brian Monzingo: I am a little weird, that's what my wife says, but I really wanted to… I…

307
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:40.790
Brian Monzingo: in… in doing research for this and looking at all the… all the banners that you have created, you and the team, the photography, the… the layout, like, the art direction, the food styling, everything, it is phenomenal. Like, I have…

308
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:46.060
Brian Monzingo: I was just so impressed, just blown away by the quality of the work that's being done, and I'm…

309
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:53.019
Brian Monzingo: And I have to apologize for, like, ripping off your work and putting in these guidelines, but it was…

310
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:59.020
Brian Monzingo: It was really inspiring, and it makes for a fantastic, like.

311
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.810
Brian Monzingo: portfolio of work that… that you and the team have. It's just amazing.

312
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:15.350
Luis Gallo: Thank you, man. Yeah, thank you. No, this is how I feel about y'all's work, too. So, I'm just trying to be as… as… as good as you guys, and, like, the work that you guys, do, so…

313
00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:21.119
Luis Gallo: But yeah, that, and I always want to make, the goal is to make your components look good.

314
00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.099
Luis Gallo: So, that's my goal.

315
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.059
Luis Gallo: I mean, that's one of my goals.

316
00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:40.380
Luis Gallo: But yeah, awesome, awesome. Well, like, if there's anything else I can do, any other tests that you need, Brian, you mentioned that you're gonna look at the scaling a little bit more. If you want me to jump in on, you know, a quick Zoom or something like that, just shoot me a link, or…

317
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:47.840
Luis Gallo: you know, we can do it, but I think overall, you know, I think it's, like, I don't see any red flags, I think you've, you've thought of everything.

318
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.280
Luis Gallo: I think we're good.

319
00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.560
Amith Kozhipuram: Awesome.

320
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:59.109
Amith Kozhipuram: Alright, in that case, I think we are done here.

321
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:04.190
Luis Gallo: Alright, well… Y'all have a good day, and, and

322
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:09.089
Luis Gallo: I'll talk to you soon, and now you can go out… now you can leave your car, Brian. Where… where you headed?

323
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:17.179
Brian Monzingo: Pretty soon, I'm just gonna go into the doctor's office here at Optum Health and have a checkup with my doctor, but everything is okay.

324
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.350
Luis Gallo: everything goes well, with that checkup.

325
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.620
Brian Monzingo: Thank you, I know it will.

326
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.200
Luis Gallo: Alright guys, y'all take care.

327
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.240
Yi Han: Thanks.

328
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.160
Brian Monzingo: Bye, too. Bye.
