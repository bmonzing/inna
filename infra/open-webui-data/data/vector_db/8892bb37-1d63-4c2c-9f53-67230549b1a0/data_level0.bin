y would be opening it to talk to a coach, it'd be around like tax season or like my husband and I kind of go through finances at the beginning of the year.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:40\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   26:43\nSo it's like, OK.\nLet me like check in and see if I can like bring anything more to the table based on conversations with Coach.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:50\nGotcha. Awesome.\nAnd but I guess when you were you when you first downloaded it, like you said about six years ago, I think and you were like starting to read out all those articles, was it more that you were going into paven and and sort of taking advantage of that?\n\n\nAlison   27:06\nYeah, yeah, totally.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:07\nThat type of content. OK, it's nice.\n\n\nAlison   27:09\nYeah, 'cause I was.\nIt was like something new and and it was. And there was always something that was like being posted that was like, oh, I didn't think about that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:12\nYeah.\n\n\nAlison   27:16\nLike, that's interesting. And like I think that's like how it has definitely differed now that I'm more financially savvy, so to speak that that's like why I don't probably use it as often as before.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:24\nMm hmm.\nAnd then So what would you say again?\nJust like kind of ranking a bit like, what would you say is the most useful piece of the pavement app for you?\n\n\nAlison   27:49\nProbably the explorer, because there's still like articles in there that I like. I'm interested in reading.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:52\nMm hmm.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   27:59\nBut it's not like I'm like, needing to go in there and like, learn now. But I think that's that's definitely looking at it now.\nI'm like, oh, it's interesting.\nIt's like more structured a little bit like it looks differently, but I did previously like and I don't when that updates care about like I just in real time kind of like OK.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   28:12\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   28:17\nThat's helpful because like some of those are not relevant to me, but like maybe I could learn more about side hustles even. I don't wanna have a side hustle.\nBut like you know what I mean? Like you can just be knowledgeable.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   28:26\nYeah. And then on the flip side, what would you say is the least kinda useful?\nPiece of it.\n\n\nAlison   28:34\nI don't wanna say it's the goal section 'cause. I think it's nice to have that visibility, but like I do feel like there's a way that like I could set up my goals differently and the life path I feel like just doesn't really do a lot for me.\nLike it's just, I don't know.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   28:54\nWould you say it's because it's like a lack of like ability to kind of individualize, personalized, almost what? Yeah.\n\n\nAlison   29:00\nKind of.\nYeah, I think I think so, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   29:05\nGotcha.\nOK.\nOK.\nAwesome. Really quickly, just to kind of wrap up, I was hoping to kind of go through some of the features within paven and just kind of rank on a scale of one to five like one being least valuable, 5 being most valuable, where you would rank these spec.\n\n\nAlison   29:21\nYes.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   29:29\nFeatures and as you go. Just kind of explain your reasoning out loud.\nAnd we'll go from there.\nThere. So let's start.\nWith.\nDrum roll.\nLet's start with articles.\nOn a scale of one to five, one least five most valuable, where would you put articles?\n\n\nAlison   29:51\nI'm at 5.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   29:53\nGotcha. OK.\nAnd what I guess kind of I 'cause I didn't ask you this point when you brought it up, but like what?\nReally strikes you about the articles in the way that Pavan presents the content.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   30:10\nI think it's like small pieces like it's almost like kind of a snapshot on some of them. And I kind of appreciated that.\nIt was like, hey, like this article is 3 minutes.\nLike OK, I have 3 minutes like let me just like dive into this and then it feels like it's like pretty interactive.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   30:21\nYep.\nRight.\n\n\nAlison   30:27\nI don't.\nMaybe it's the way that it's like visually.\nIt's it's not a ton of information.\nIt's not like I feel like I'm, like, reading this article that like, I'm like going through, which like I would digest that and I'd love that. But I feel like for this, it's like you just kind of scroll through.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   30:39\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   30:42\nAnd it's like seem less.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   30:44\nMm hmm. Yep, Yep. Yep for sure.\nOK. That's great to hear.\nAll right. Next let's say the the polls feature.\nSo where would you put from 1:00 to 5:00? The the polls feature?\n\n\nAlison   30:58\nThe polls feature.\nI don't think I knew that existed.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:00\nYes. Oh, the polls, OK.\nSo yeah, so I don't know. So in the.\nAs of January this year, we started sending out polls in the newsletter as well, but you can also take them in the app.\nSo I think our latest one is.\nIt should have an option to take the poll on the screen.\nLet me see if I can get to it. On my home screen, yes.\nSo if you like go to your home screen and maybe refresh it under your next steps.\nI think the first one is what's your money dial?\n\n\nAlison   31:39\nOh, OK, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:41\nYeah. And so you can take that poll.\nYeah. OK. All right.\n\n\nAlison   31:47\nThat's interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:48\nAnd we send out polls like once a month.\n\n\nAlison   31:48\nI kind of looked at that as like, oh, interesting. OK.\nYeah, I kind of looked at that of like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:52\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   31:55\nIt was just another like goal because there's a lot more of like setup goal and I'm like well, that's not relevant.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:59\nMm hmm. Yep.\n\n\nAlison   32:00\nSo I I don't think I deep dived into that, but that's interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:03\nOK. OK. Nice, nice.\nDo you think that that's a feature that you would explore more if, like a topic came through or that that kind of struck a chord with you?\n\n\nAlison   32:13\nYeah, I think so, for sure, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:17\nAlright, let's Speaking of goals, let's go to goals now. So on from 1:00 to 5:00.\n\n\nAlison   32:21\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:22\nWhere would you put that?\n\n\nAlison   32:24\nProbably like A2.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:26\nGotcha.\nGotcha. OK. And I know we've kind of talked about that.\nJust like again, not being as relevant for you and.\nYeah, like all the boxes kind of being checked.\n\n\nAlison   32:40\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:42\nAnd let's say the the connect with a coach feature.\n\n\nAlison   32:46\nFive whole heartedly.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:48\nMm hmm.\nAwesome love hearing about the great experiences that you've had with the with the coaches.\n\n\nAlison   32:55\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:55\nThat makes me very happy.\n\n\nAlison   32:56\nYeah, I was.\nI was scared to jump on the phone with the first person.\nHe's like, it's so much easier to talk over the phone. If I was chatted, I was like I'm over the phone.\nI was like, Oh my God. Like, how is this a benefit for us like?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:05\nMm.\n\n\nAlison   33:07\nAnd it was amazing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:08\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   33:08\nSo I've never done the tax.\nOh, that's actually maybe some feedback, like the tax specific educator.\nThere's never any options available, so just FYI.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:15\nYep.\nGotcha.\nGotcha. Good to know. Thank you.\nAnd so with the coaching thing like, is that something that you would have kind of? Is that something you could have seen yourself trying to kind of figure out and uncover within the meta landscape without paven or was it just like paven presented it to you you were?\nLike, oh, let me jump on this.\nAnd then it's like, oh, this is really nice.\n\n\nAlison   33:46\nI remember probably Paven presenting it via like one of the benefits updates like they may have done, like a they probably. I remember this they probably did like an event and they shared and I was just like this is amazing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:51\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   34:00\nI need to do this and this probably a little bit like about six years ago, so for however long.\nSo yeah, I think it would have been presented to me and then it actually took me a little bit to actually do the coach thing because I think that I there was a little bit of hesitation because I felt.\nIt wasn't set up with my finances.\nI don't wanna like bring attention to it.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:20\nYep, Yep.\n\n\nAlison   34:21\nAnd then it was like, oh wait, I feel better. Let's talk.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:24\nGotcha. OK, interesting.\nI know the feeling.\nSometimes I'm like even just with my sister.\n\n\nAlison   34:29\nYou're right.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:32\nSometimes 'cause we're kind of and I feel like opposite ends right now. And whenever I start talking, I'm like maybe I won't talk to you right now. That's great.\n\n\nAlison   34:41\nTotally.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:44\nOK, next.\nWhat about the the budget feature?\n\n\nAlison   34:50\nDidn't know it existed and had to find it, so I've never really used it.\nI also use a separate tool for budgeting outside of paven, so that is what is like my day-to-day, which is the copilot app.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   35:00\nHmm.\nGotcha. OK.\nYep. OK, that makes sense.\nWhat about the the Journeys feature?\n\n\nAlison   35:17\nThat I feel like, is that like the life path or which one was the journey?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   35:23\nSo journey.\n\n\nAlison   35:24\nOh, I see your personal guide.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   35:29\nLet's see.\nUmm.\nSo yeah. So the journeys, if you go on the homepage, it's like that icon in between the profile and the search.\nAnd that has a list of the journeys, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   35:43\nYeah.\nI think I've looked at it previously and then that was kind of like how I was feeling about it where it was just like, OK, this is not as relevant, but now that I'm looking at it again, it's like, OK, interesting, like caring for your family like that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   35:54\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   35:56\nIs actually going to be interesting for me. Like, I definitely think that need to think more about like estate planning and like raising kids. So actually I'll probably.\nJump into this and like start some journeys with those that are more relevant to me.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   36:18\nAnd then lastly the newsletter.\nAre you subscribed to the to the newsletter?\n\n\nAlison   36:25\nI don't think so actually.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   36:26\nDon't think so. OK. OK, gotcha.\nIs that something that you could like, see yourself being interested in or what would you and what if so? Like, what would you like to see in a in a pivot newsletter?\n\n\nAlison   36:40\nYeah, totally.\nI think that whatever I look for in the financial newsletters is like real time.\nLike real? Not like real time information, but like the way the world turns, it is quick and like people.\nSituations can also change in different areas, so I feel like what I've really enjoyed from seeing newsletters is like updates on what's happening that matters financially.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:00\nOK.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   37:08\nMore specific, you know what I mean.\nAnd like tariffs are the conversation right now?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:10\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   37:13\nBut like you know what I mean?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:13\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   37:14\nLike I don't.\nI don't know that I wanna see another article on tariffs.\nBut I do not like if it's something like that that's relevant.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:18\nRight.\n\n\nAlison   37:23\nAnd maybe more specific for high earners in tech.\nLike that's interesting.\nYou know what I mean? So.\nI think that might be interesting. Just knowing that we have Haven as a benefit, but.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:36\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   37:38\nJust love to read and like digest stuff, so I'd be open to whatever.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:42\nYeah. Awesome. Awesome.\nWell, we are kind of nearing the end of our time and I don't want to run over before we wrap up.\nDo you have any kind of last questions for me or anything you wish that I had anything you wish I had asked that I didn't get to.\n\n\nAlison   37:54\nNo, this has been great.\nNo, thank you.\nYeah. Appreciate the context and and sharing. I think it's really interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:00\nSo.\n\n\nAlison   38:03\nAnd yeah, it's it's definitely helped me as a tool, so I'm excited to kind of deep dive, maybe a little regularly.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:04\nMm hmm.\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n\nAlison   38:12\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:12\nWe you know this as you know, this kind of pavement research community is something that we started pretty recently and this is our first actually study with members of the PAVAN Research community. And so, you know, part of it is to kind of have a pool for us.\n\n\nAlison   38:18\nOh, OK.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:29\nTo pull from and talk to more regularly as we're kind of in for, you know, going down the product road map, but also we want to keep y'all in the loop as well to kind of share updates about where things.\nAre going and how insights are being kind of translated into the app.\n\n\nAlison   38:43\nI love it. Yeah, that's awesome.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:44\nYeah. Awesome. Awesome.\nWell, thank you so much for being so generous of your time.\nIt was really wonderful to meet you and talk to you, Allison.\n\n\nAlison   38:52\nYeah, you too.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:52\nThank you and have a wonderful holiday weekend.\n\n\nAlison   38:56\nYeah, you too.\nStay. Stay dry out there.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:59\nThanks.

More time after that is up to you. \n\n\n\nIntroducing the Childfree\n\nBACKGROUNDHENRY and DINK articles received significantly higher engagement than other Paven articles. To see if 30-something HENRY DINKs (and SINKs) in the San Francisco Bay Area would be a valid group with Paven's focus, secondary research was performed April 2025.\n\nSUMMARIZED FINDINGSHENRY is a mentality that helps us understand the lifestyle desires of 30-somethings, whereas SINK and DINK is a choice of this demographic to be childfree. \n\nTo evaluate whether this pattern reflects a momentary fluctuation or a sustained trend, we broadened our focus to the Millennial generation, which includes 30-something HENRYs, DINKs, and SINKs. Despite coming of age during two recessions, the growing cost of living, student loans, and for the highly educated, \"greedy jobs,\" Millennials found a way to have the life they want. They chose to be childfree. 47% of all adults 18-49 chose to be childfree in 2024, up from 37% in 2018 (Pew Research Center). As Millennial finances deteriorate, even among once-insulated techies, the childfree trend shows no signs of slowing.If 30-39 is the largest age group in the SF Bay Area, 30-34 is the largest age group in the US and almost half of Paven users are 30-something. then Meta is likely to have a significant number of FTEs in their 30s. If 55% of the SF Bay Area households consist of 1-2 people, it is likely that Metamates will follow (or surpass) national trends and choose to be childfree.\n\nNote: For the sake of initial foundational content, we have dropped the focus on the San Francisco Bay Area as a point of focus.   \n\nThose findings here: HENRY SINKs and DINKs secondary.pptx\n\nBenefits of Choosing Childfree\n\nFreedom in lifestyle\n\nFlexible travel options\n\nEnhanced quality of relationships\n\nTime for personal development\n\nOpportunities for career advancement\n\nLess non-negotiable expenses\n\nMore disposable income\n\nEasier to save\n\nLess financial stress\n\nCareer Mobility\n\nChildfree defined: a choice\n\nVs. Childless (derogatory)\n\nAlso known as: SINK (single income no kids), DINK (dual income no kids), OINK (one income no kids)\n\nWhy \"Childfree\" is a thing\n\nAs HENRY, SINK/DINK etc reflect a modern way to aspire to the American Dream, choosing to be childfree is a realistic way to achieve that aspiration especially as it becomes less accessible to Millennials (people now in their late 20s and early 40s).\n\nWhat else you must know\n\nBeing Childfree is not unusual. Almost half of all adults 18-49 choose to be childfree in 2024.\n\nBecause this is a relatively new trend, financial advice has not yet caught up\n\nInterests of the Childfree\n\nLiving the good life\n\nPurpose\n\nCareer Growth\n\nNeeds of the childfree\n\nFinancial knowledge\n\nLife planning\n\nSupport in choosing a nontraditional path\n\nPitfalls of the childfree\n\nFamily financial bingo\n\nUntailored financial advice\n\nDisproportionate work\n\n\n\nYou may hear things like this\u2026\n\nVideo playtime 1:16\n\n\n\nThe Childfree have legitimate reasons for their choice\n\nIt's too hard and expensive to have kids in the US\n\nEldercare > a future child\n\nLife on my own terms\n\n\"Once a parent, always a parent. The life-changing permanence of that identity scares me more than it has ever excited or tempted me. I want to live my life on my own terms, rather than have another human wholly dependent on me to make the right/safe/good choices for them.\" -u/kittaia\n\n\"I was raised by a single mother in a house with my grandparents and my great-grandmother. Ever since I can remember I had to be responsible because my great-grandmother needed a lot of care, as did my grandfather...So I've already spent a big part of my life taking care of others and putting what I wanted to do on the back burner. Now, my mother needs to be taken care of and that alone takes up a lot of my 'free' time...I just see the burden of all of it, plus there's no way I could afford it either. The money I have left over goes to taking care of my mother's needs, so there wouldn't be any left for a child.\" -u/runtime_error_run\n\n\"This is US-centric but I feel very strongly that in this culture, you have to reeeeaaally want kids above all else because there's no other culture in the world that actively works against parents in such a profound way. No parental leave, no universal healthcare, childcare is prohibitively expensive, and we work so fucking hard day after day after day so that doing anything else, like playing with your kids, is so exhausting.\" -u/WalterBishRedLicrish\n\n\n\nMost ideas come from this person: Jay Zigmont\n\nHere's a preview into some of his ideas (click on picture for short video)\n\nNote: We tried hard to find other financial voices on the childfree. \n\nEven when we extensively googled elsewhere, he was the one being quoted or interviewed.  \n\nKEY BOOKS\n\n\"I think there's like this assumption that like, if you are childfree, like a check falls from the sky and makes you rich. And that's just not true.

There is not much competition here when it comes to content.\n\nTRADITIONAL FINANCIAL ADVICE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CHILDFREE Tax Strategies Includes taking advantage of tax credits like Earned Income Tax Credit, Child and Dependent Care Credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit. Childfree cannot take advantage of these credits. Childfree couples: choice between filing jointly or separately Childfree couples who are not married cannot give unlimited monetary gifts to each other Life Insurance needs Term life insurance is a necessity should something happen to you and there is no one to take care of your dependents Unlikely to need extra life insurance because they have no dependents. Disability insurance Disability insurance is important for anyone supporting their family, in case you are unable to work due to illness or injury Childfree, particularly \"soloists\" are also more likely to need disability insurance Financial advising Most financial advising assumes growth, and because of that, most advisors charge a percentage of Assets under Management as a fee. C Dying with a lot of excess wealth means they have not used it to live the life they want to the full. End of life issues Yes, everyone needs an end-of-life plan Who will execute, be your power attorney, be the beneficiary of that plan? Inheritance Issues It's nice to leave a little something for your kids Dying with a lot of excess wealth means they have not used it to live the life they want to the full. Retirement strategies Withdraw 4% per year in retirement // save for \"retirement phase of life\" Do not need as much money in retirement because they likely will have less financial burdens like paying for college, ensuring inheritable income etc. // may not actually have an extended \"retirement phase\" Life Planning Assumes children, therefore heirs, and usually a more traditionally prescribed life. In relation, have much more time on their hands, so must plan their lives with much more intent.\n\n\n\nRelated philosophies\n\nFILE vs FIRE. \n\nFILE FIRE Live life now Live life later Continue to follow passions, finding the balance between time, freedom and money; do not turn off Work really hard now, then turn off Some sacrifices now, do not necessarily do everything on the cheap Sacrifice now, do things on the cheap Dimmer switch for work On/off switch for work \"mini retirements\" or multiple career breaks One retirement Essentially investing in yourself Essentially investing in your retirement plan Slower progress Faster progress\n\nDIE WITH ZERO\n\nNot literally \"zero\"\n\nA philosophy popularized by Bill Perkins\n\nPrioritize experiences over accumulating wealth\n\nRecognize the tradeoffs between money, wealth and health to prioritize how to maximize your enjoyment of your life\n\n\n\nCommon Pitfalls of the Childfree\n\nFamily Financial Bingo Disproportionate Work Bequeathing by default Bingo: 35% say they've been expected to take on extra work responsibilities Giving with a \"warm\" hand instead of a \"cold\" one when you are dead so that you can enjoy the emotional/relational benefits of that giving If you don't intentionally plan your estate or have a next of kin, government and healthcare organizations will make decisions for you.

She's checked all those boxes now (and in the app, there's no way to select/check 'I've done that')\n\nHas had 'immensely helpful' convos on at least two occasions w/ coaches\n\nLifePath...likes the notion of a check box, but, again, she feels like she's checked all the boxes so there's no where left for her to go\n\nOverall: higher level of financial literacy, has already gone through the life moments Paven focuses on and has a solid plan for retirement already...she's essentially 'graduated' from what Paven offers her now (with the exception of chatting with coaches)\n\nHas been ~6 months since she last logged into Paven, had gone in to chat w/ coach\n\nNow, she logs in during big money moments every 6 months or so, going mainly to talk to a coach ('not a lot to look at/for anymore') \n\nWhat's most useful: explore\n\nNoticed the enhanced/better structure and findability since the app's inception, now more helpful for navigation\n\nThough based on what she uses most nowadays, feels like coach is the actual feature most useful to her\n\nWhat's least useful: goals/LifePath\n\nNot relevant for her, cannot personalize\n\nWhat's missing for her: community\n\nIt's tough because financial talk is a bit of a 'black hole' (people just don't want to talk about finances), but would be cool to connect with Metamates in a similar financial/life spot and grow with peers\n\nAs a recruiter, she has pitched Paven to Metamates on numerous occasions (is a big advocate for the app), and every time no one knew about it\n\nWhere's the communication breakdown?

That was \"take this job and shove it\" in 2008 money.\"\n\nIn 2024, that bar would be $4.5M today\n\n\"In 2008, I put the HENRYs' household income range at between $250,000 and $500,000.

likely not get there. \n\nHarder to achieve the \"american dream\"\n\n\"Mostly members of two-income families, HENRYs interviewed by Tully said they were strapped for cash mainly due to rising federal, state, and property taxes, \"plus the knife of the [alternative minimum tax].\" They blamed the squeeze on investments in their children, including paying for private colleges, day care, and private lessons, like \"dance, tennis, or gymnastics.\" https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trophy-wife-hedge-fund-henry-110000727.html\n\nDINK:originated in 1987 in the yuppie culture of that area, to

And that's just not true. There are people who are struggling who have kids and people are struggling who don't have kids. So income disparities still exist.\"\n\n(income gap disappears between sexes if you look at childfree couples)\n\n\"As a whole, most childfree folks don't have a priority on how much money they give to the next generation. The way my wife and I say it is our nephews get what's left over. If they get $10,000 or $100,000, that's fine. But if they get $1 million, we made a mistake. And it's kind of something akin to a die-with-zero approach. And if you're not trying to pass on money to the next generation, it changes assumptions in your financial plan. And then when we add on that a vast majority of childfree folks aren't looking at the standard retirement structure, where they're looking at more of what we call FILE\u2014financial independence, live early\u2014kind of a dial-back-on-work rather than a complete cutout. If you're not going to retire and you're not going to pass on money to the next generation, a lot of assumptions change in \n\nyour financial plan. Even things like life insurance have a very small purpose for childfree folks.\"\n\nFor singles: \"Nearly zero usage for people that are what we call soloists, single with no kids. Things like long-term care we know we have to plan for, although the truth is everybody should do that. It starts changing all these assumptions. And the end result is for a childfree person, you actually have to do life planning first rather than just financial planning. Because there's so many options that if you don't create a life plan first, you may get to a goal that is not yours. The bonus of being a parent is there's kind of like a culturally accepted standard life script. You go to school, you get married, you have kids, you work 25 years, pass the money to the next generation, all this stuff. When you're living a life of childfree wealth, the way we look at it is you have time, money, and freedom to do what you enjoy, but it's almost too much. It's like, what do we do if we can live anywhere? What do we do with our jobs? What do we do with our life? And it's one of those things where if you follow the standard financial advice, you might get to your goal, but it might not be your goal. It might just be the one that's set for you.\"\n\n\"the challenge is if you're going to give money, you're better off giving that throughout your life rather than at the end of life.\"  \n\n4% retirement rule is actually too much for people with no kids. \n\nUnique issue for childless: \"financial bingo\" because get called to take care of X family member: need to know personal comfort levels and set boundary before hand \n\nUnexpected finances: \"what we found is your parents' planning, or lack thereof, has more of an impact on your financial plan than your own choices.\"\n\nWho will execute my estate plan, be more medical power of attorney, be my financial power of attorney?\n\nIn CA and AZ can appoint a professional fiduciary, other states a trust company (but they won't want you as a client if you want to die with zero, otherwise have no other options\n\nOther potentially relevant ideas\n\nFILE: financial independence, live early.

If we're giving them money and we're 90 and they're getting it when they're 60, there's less of a use of it. If you think about your life, you could have used a little hand up earlier in life, whether that was in your 20s or whatever it is, whether it was college or whatever it may be. You're better off helping them then. That's why we have 529 plans for our nephews. That's why we have ways we want to give money to them.

While 57% of employees cited wanting better benefits, only 13% admitted that they had made a career transition.

He has tried to \"avoid companies that don't align with me morally,\" but he's getting desperate.  It doesn't help that many people assume that privileged techies have it easy. \"A lot of tech people are shitheads, and their problems are absolutely first-world. \u2026 If they ended up jobless tomorrow, [they] would land on their feet,\" said Billy. \"But I'm from the middle of nowhere, West Virginia. I have six figures of student loan debt. If I run out of savings, I'm on the street. I hope that we can find some common empathy for everybody.\"\n\nUNIQUE TECH COMPANY RELATED FINANCIAL CHALLENGES\n\nFront loaded earnings:  meaning, earnings will tend to grow less quickly than others\n\nManaging a volatile industry\n\nTechnology firms hire and lay workers off routinely, especially as they are often heavily financed by debt and investment. A good advisor can help you prepare for the ups-and-downs that come with this kind of career.\n\nCommon for tech workers to freelance or contract\n\n\"Yet the financial profile of this kind of work is very different from that of a W-2 employee. You need to prepare for funding your own health insurance and retirement accounts, as well as the feast and famine nature of self-employment and all of the expenses associated with it. A financial advisor who has experience working with your industry can help you consider all that.\"\n\nStock options and benefits \n\nLimiting risk by knowing how much to keep in concentrated company stock vs tax burden if you sell\n\n\"One of the biggest financial planning challenges for Silicon Valley and tech executives is sizing up risk, according to Dave Alison, president and founding partner of Prosperity Capital Advisors. More specifically, determining how much of their net worth they should keep in concentrated company stock and understanding the tax implications of selling to lower their risk.\"\n\nEnsuring you've withheld sufficient taxes from stock based compensaton\n\nFor the public traded company executives, the most acute challenges are managing their stock-based compensation to make sure sufficient taxes are being withheld or they have a plan to pay what is owed, said Tony Blagrove, CEO and founder of Traveka Wealth. Otherwise, Blagrove said they could be surprised by an unexpectedly large tax bill and need to scramble to find the money to pay for it - an unnecessary yet fairly common occurrence.\n\nHow to weigh private company equity tax, liquidity and potential stock option success\n\n\"Ultimately, the key lesson is that concentration can make you rich, but diversification can keep you rich.\"\n\nEducation on components of equity compensation including related tax treatments\n\nFinally, outside of educating clients on the alphabet soup of RSUs, RSAs, ISOs, and NQSOs that might make up their equity compensation, Joe Lum, regional president of MAI Capital Management, said it's important to understand the tax treatment of each vehicle and the timing of when the tax liability is owed.\n\n\"For an executive at a publicly traded company, it is common for the income tax for vested RSUs to be withheld at the federal supplemental tax rate, generally around 22 percent, which is likely much lower than the effective tax rate. Without proper cash flow planning, this can cause an unwelcome surprise come April 15 or even underpayment penalties,\" Lum said. \n\nYear-round tax planning can help avoid this pitfall by understanding the vesting schedule of all equity compensation and reviewing the client's paystub on an ongoing basis and adjusting withholdings if necessary, Lum said.\n\n\n\nSINK (single income, no kids)\n\n\"A SINK can be anyone of any gender identity, and is typically settled into their career, is somewhat financially stable, and will tell you confidently that they feel fulfilled.\"\n\nIf SINK is female, may earn less than men b/c of gender pay gap\n\n2024 study: 47% of single women say living on their single income is a major source of stress for them \n\nRecs: \n\nemergency fund, \n\nknow spending habits and correct for lifestyle creep, \n\nknow what money movers make highest impact and then set and forget (max out 401k, chip away high interest debt, set deposits on autopilot)\n\nsave for something you really want (home, travel, business, retire early, forever couch)\n\nhave a tax strategy\n\nSINK means fewer tax credits and more tax owed than married counterparts---try to reduce taxable income for current year through 401k, 403b, trad ira, has etc\u2026\n\nStart estate planning \n\nHENRYs #HENRY, #WealthBuilding, #FinancialFreedom, and #InvestingTips\n\nHENRY Finance | Substack\u00a0: last post July 2023\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/high_earner_not_rich_yet/\n\nEllevest thinks being a HENRY is a defining feature of being millenial\n\nPrivate account of a 39 year old lawyer earning $700K/year.

EXPRESSING MY AUTHENTIC SELF VS \nFINDING BELONGING IN FACEBOOK \nCULTURE\nFacebook's mission focuses on building\ncommunity, which isemphasized both in\nFacebook product andculture .Authenticity and\nbelonging aretheroots ofcommunity building\nand apre-requisite for getting people to\nconsume (learn and seek guidance) and\ncontribute (share) meaningfully .\n2.MEANINGFUL VSMEASURABLE\nFacebook's quantitative culture around\nmeasurement canconflict with what employees\nfind meaningful \u2013both personally and in\nrelation to the business .Employees\npassionately strive tocreate impact but feel\nrestricted bythe need tofocus on the\nquantifiable .3.SPEAKING UP TO SEEK GUIDANCE VS\nSIGNALING STRENGTH\nWhile thismay contradict Facebook's \"fail fast\"\nmindset, when itcomes tofinances, employees\nstill feel the need toappear confident about\nmoney even when they're not, even when\nencouraged toproactively seek help.\n4.FEELING GRATEFUL VSASSERTING MY\nVALUE\nOutside of the tech industry, the high\ncompensation and generous benefits at\nFacebook areperceived differently than when\nsomeone isinside theindustry .Employees want\ntoretain thesense ofgratitude they feelbefore\nthey entered theindustry, butthey also want to\nensure they are being rewarded on-par with\ntheir FBandindustry colleagues .5.CARING FOR MY LOVED ONES VS\nSECURING MYFUTURE\nEchoing the inside versus outside tech industry \nperception, Facebook employees both want to \nand feel the pressure to financially provide for \ntheir family, friends, and larger community and \nfear that expressing concern over their financial \nstate would be negatively perceived.\n6. PURSING MY PASSIONS VS COVERING \nMY BASES\nThis dilemma stems from Facebook's \"ruthless \nprioritization\" principle of pursuing the most \ninfluential idea first. Employees are applying this \nwork principle to their personal life, and as a \nresult, not focusing on their financial well -being.Check! | Confidential and proprietary \u00a9 2019 Round Feather, Inc. 65FinWell | Journey@ Facebook\nA VISION FOR REFRAMING AND SCALING CARE\nTaking a bird's eye view, we see how these e motional \ndilemmas come together to create tension along two \ncore axes \u2013who I am and how I act.

This is a struggle between authenticity and \nbelonging. The paradox here is that without authenticity, there is no true belonging.The struggle between Agency and Guidance\nThis bleeds into how I act at work. Because when my authenticity is limited, I struggle \nto express my agency, the ability to trust myself and chart my own course. On the \nother hand, without a sense of belonging, I struggle to take guidance from others.\nCheck! | Confidential and proprietary \u00a9 2019 Round Feather, Inc. 67FinWell | Journey@ Facebook\nA VISION FOR REFRAMING AND SCALING CARE\nCreating emotional safety by resolving core tensions\nCreating emotional safety at the workplace\nWhen these tensions are resolved, employees feel \nemotionally safe at work \u2013safe to ask their questions, \nto express who they are, and to make decisions for \nthemselves.\nHumanizing communication around care\nThis framework doesn't just explain dynamics, however. \nWhen communicating the value of Facebook benefits, \nit's important to reframe how Life@ cares for its \nemployees not just on a functional level but on a \nhuman level.\nIntangible values of benefits\nLife@ has the opportunity to communicate its offerings \nin terms of supporting who employees are, in allowing \nthem to show up to work authentically, and in creating \na culture of belonging.

I am aware of the negative side of not having children, however I prefer focusing on the advantages that it brings me, financially and lifestyle-wise.\n\nIt always surprises me how socially-culturally childfree people are seen as \"selfish\". To me, arguments like \"you're going to be alone\", \"who's going to take care of you when you're older\", \"wouldn't you like a mini version of yourself?\" are selfish reasons to have kids.\n\nI think this choice connects deeply with women reproductive rights and how the concept of \"parenthood\" has been evolving in the last decades. Part of this is also because our generation grew up alongside major technological advancements that changed our worldview. Thanks to the internet, we were able to question our perspectives on religion, environment, economy, mental health, medical advancements, different family structures and how this affects us and our decision of having children or not.\n\nJolene\n\nI am a millennial who is childfree--I'd put us as DINKWADS, so the research resonated with me. All of the reasons for not having children, align with mine. Though if you ask my parents, they're still waiting for me to change my mind.\n\nI was not aware of how much of the population of 18-49 US adults choose to be childfree. 47%. Very interesting!\n\nHow relevant it is to our users. I also really loved your research on how financial advice we see doesn't take this into consideration. You're right! I've been buying a lot of finance books lately, and they do all expect you to have kids. I don't have a single one that I've read that is for DINKWADS/SINKS/DINKS or really anyone childfree.\n\nGloria\n\n\n\n(BG)\n\nI know the majority of it, but without the exact numbers/percentages. It is a topic which has been close to me, and I have watched and listened to a lot of materials. As a millennial myself, this one hits close to home.\n\n\n\nThat HALF of millennials don't want kids. I thought it was way less.\n\n\n\nFIRST PERSON QUOTES\nQuotes which we (millennials) have heard, \"Who is going to take care of you when you are older?\", \"Time is ticking\", \"All your classmates are already with a second\", \"Don`t you think I deserve a grandchild,\" etc. - But those are from my side of the world, where the mentality may be a bit different.\n\nAngie\n\nThat being childfree is like a millennial cheat code \u2013 but only b/c I heard that from you already!\n\n\n\nThat there's at least one financial thought leader focused on the childfree segment.\n\n\n\nNot surprising, per se, but I liked the breakdown of the common pitfalls of being childfree. Not something I've ever thought about before but they all make sense.\n\nThat being childfree is a choice and should not be looked down upon or criticized.\n\n\n\nLeif\n\n\n\nNotes very granular things: may want to segment even further\n\nKnew that Long Term Care Planning was really important to this audience; and that they still needed estate planning\n\n\n\nDidn't know of all the distinctions btwn Childfree, Childless by circumstance, Childless by choice, etc. Really could be different populations to serve (CFP article)\n\n\n\nI think it's important to hear about the research suggesting the childfree population may have two segments by mindset, 'Independents' vs 'social' - being able to grapple with such a decision and withstand social pressure means the person likely has a clear vision/values and can be deliberate (BPS)\n\nAlso Leif:\n\nOther things I learned \n\nHigher education among women is correlated to childfree; opposite for men (Pew research) \n\nDisability insurance more important than life insurance (CFP article) \n\nFor many Childfree individuals, the goal may not even be to retire, or it may be to embrace an alternative retirement structure. (CFP article) \n\nSometimes negative experiences from childhood create a fear or avoidance of reliving, such as poverty or raising siblings (Buzzfeed, Stories of Strength) \n\nLots of different 'circumstances' that get in the way (climate, lack of family, lack of partner, etc).  Do those people have resolution on their feelings?

Overall, this workshop has been designed to allow for \n\nImmersing ourselves in Childfree segment learnings to create empathy\n\nApplying these learnings to Paven \n\nWith built-in opportunities for Individual Reflection along the way\n\n\n\nSCOTTY: \nBefore we get started, I want to reinforce important guidelines for our time together today:\n\nThis time is for you and your team to learn about this segment and think about how to apply these learnings to Paven content\n\n If you think something is interesting, then it's interesting. There are no bad thoughts or questions. \n\nWe recognize that the topics we'll be discussing today are very personal. (You've already been quite open with us in the pre-work, which we thank you for). This is a safe space. Paramount today is us all feeling comfortable in the space, and open. \n\nIf something is not clear, please ask. We're all learning together. \n\nWe have an agenda and want to maximize our time together. But, ultimately, this time is really yours...so it will be what you make of it.\n\nAnd last but not least, remote workshops can be difficult - but please try to stay present and distraction free (turn on that Do Not Disturb status or better yet, close out of Teams, Email). \n\n\n(11:37am EST) grace: PREWORK 5 MIN\n\n\nWe gave you all some pre-work...\n\nFor any one who emailed responses, anyone care to share? What stuck out to you? What open questions do you have? \n\n\n\n\n[here's what stood out to me from what I heard back]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 minutes\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nIf we boiled everything to one main insight it is this: \nTraditional financial advice does NOT consider the childfree\n\nWith that in mind, we're going to dive deeper into the implications of this today in 3 ways\n\nONE: Given that this segment has chosen to live childfree as \"financial hack\"...\n\n\nwe're going to get into their mindset and think what financial wellbeing might mean to them.  \n\nwe'll also about the reason for they feel like they need to \"hack\" their finances: we'll think through what kind of life they actually want\n\n\n\nTWO: Given that not all financial advice fits the childfree, but some does ...\n\n\nwe're going to explore the difference\n\n\nwe're going to explore what it might mean to get advice that fits you\n\nand have a taste for what it might look like to live your best life\n\n\nTHREE:  \nAnd after all this reflection, planning, finanical action,\n\n\nwe're going to explore how unexpected pitfalls and pushback might effect the childfree\n\n\n\n\nLet's get started...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(11:42am EST) grace IMMERSION ONE 20 MIN\n\n\n\nPOINT OF EXERCISE\nTo begin immersing in the childfree mindset, which is about enabling the life you really want\n\nGRACE: begin to share screen at clouds: here https://www.figma.com/board/FRZLfQT0O30SwBsaSIzIc6/Metamate-research?node-id=660-2076&t=8BURdjxduQUk0Qli-4\n\n\n\nGRACE: We're now going to do a 30-second guided exercise to get into the mindset of this segment. \n\n\nSCOTTY: GUIDED EXERCISE SCRIPT 30 SEC\n\nClose your eyes. Take a deep breath in...and out.\n\nWith each breath in, I want you to set aside your own choices and circumstances. Gently place them to the side.\n\nNow, imagine you're taking your own wants and goals and stepping into a new life not defined by having kids or not wanting to have kids. One where the decision not to have children wasn't default, but deeply considered.\n\n\nReally open up to that life and step into that mindset. [For some, this might be easier \u2013 remember not everyone might be the same as you. For others, this might be harder. Embrace that.] As you step into that mindset, sense the questions it raises. The freedoms it protects. The meaning it creates. The decisions it may enable...\n\nTake one more deep breath in...and out. Now, open your eyes, and we want to carry this childfree mindset with us as we throughout this workshop \u2013 acknowledging...setting those aside and then return to the childfree mindset \n\n\n\n---\nGRACE to share figjam board: https://www.figma.com/board/FRZLfQT0O30SwBsaSIzIc6/Metamate-research?node-id=660-2190&t=8BURdjxduQUk0Qli-4\n\nSCOTTY: We want you to carry that through and live in that mindset for the duration of this workshop. You have now chosen to be childfree. You are childfree.\n\n\n\nGRACE:   We've shared a board with you in the Teams Chat.\n\n\n\nBeing childfree is a hack. It's a Millennial hack to get at the American Dream, to get the life you want, on your own terms, to achieve your dreams. \n\nAs a childfree person, what does financial wellbeing mean to you? How would you described it to someone else who is considering to be childfree? How does it make you feel? (Or perhaps, what emotions would you stop feeling?). What would you still have to keep in mind? \n\nWe created a board for you to record these answers. We'll give you 2 minutes alone to write out what it would mean to you, and then we'll share.\n\n\n\n\nTIMER 2 minutes: SCOTTY\n\n\n\nTIMER for 5 minutes discussion: SCOTTY\n\nOk, what do you all think?   Does anyone want to share what wellbeing would look like to someone who is considering to be childfree? \n\n\n\n[note patterns, lack of of understanding etc]\n\n\n\nWhat emotions would you stop feeling? What's one thing you never have to worry about?\n\n\n\nWhat is one thing you'd still have to keep in mind?\n\n\n\n[make some sort of affirming summary statement of responses]\n\n\n\n---\n\n[move screen to next section of the board: stay zoomed out, and lower purple box to expose \"your ideal childfree life\" exercise]\n\n\n\nIf you could follow me down the screen, we've created a board for each of you.  Please take one.  If you double click on \"I'm childfree\" you can replace it with your name.\n\n\n\nNow that we know what financial wellbeing would mean to you, let's flesh out what that wellbeing might enable.  What kind of life would yo ube able to have if you were a childfree person?  \n\nThis may seem easy, but it's actually pretty hard for many to know what they want.\n\nHere are some actual questions Jay Zigmont, a childfree financial expert, has his childfree clients actually think through.\n\n\nWhat in my life brings me joy?\n\nWhat would I do if I could do anything and not fail?\n\nIs my goal retirement?\n\nWhat can I change now that would make me happier?\n\nWhat did I always want to do with my life? Why didn't I do it?\n\n\n\nAs a childfree person, let's think through some of these questions ---for the sake of time, let's go with our top of mind answers. \nWe're going to give you 3 minutes. Please answer as many questions as you can.\n\n\n\nTIMER 3 minutes: SCOTTY\n\n\n\nTIMER for 8 minutes discussion : SCOTTY\n\nNow let's go around and share...\n\nHow did you answer some of these questions?  \n\n\n\nAh yeah, what about someone else?  etc...\n\n\n[make some sort of affirming summary statement of responses]\n\n\n\n\n\nCongrats!  We just finished our first dive into the childfree---let me recap for you...\n\n\nWe thought about what it means to financially well according to someone who was childfree..\n\n[add reflections on their discussions]\n\n\n\nAs far as I can tell so far, Jay Zigmont doesn't talk about financial wellbeing, but he talks about \"financial independence.\"   \n\nFinancial independence to him is about finding the balance betweeen life, work and your finances.  \n\nFinancial independence to him means that you have managed your money to a point where you can make ends meet and don't have to worry about finances every day. \n\nThis s possible with careful budgeting, staying out of debt, and saving/investing. Financial independence happens when you are intentional and follow a plan.\n\n\nFinancial independence and wellbeing, as we discussed looks different for each person\n\n\nChoosing to be childfree and financially independent is about achieving what you want in life. \n\nAnd we wanted a variety of things....[summary of the things they mentioned]\n\n\n[add reflections on their discussions]\n\n\n\nNext, we're going to dive into how we create a plan to be financially well and independent.  But first, let's follow this line to the board connected to it, and reflect.\n\n\n\n(12:02pm EST) haila: REFLECTION AFTER IMMERSION ONE 5 MIN\n\n\n\nIf Haila not around, then whoever did not just talk will lead this.\n\n\n\nAfter each immersion we're going to have a time for reflection.\n\n\nLet's take a moment for you to reflect individually on the activity we just walked through\n\nThere is personal space for each of you on the Figjam board.

We keep running into advice that assumes this traditional life script.\n\nThis is the traditional life journey:\n\nWhich parts of the script would be different for you as a childfree person?  How would it be different? \n\nTIMER 2 minutes: GRACE\n\nTIMER for 3 minutes discussion: GRACE\n\n\n\nNow, let's look at life in a more granular way.  Let's look at these areas in particular: \n\n\n\nWhich of these would be different for you?  How so?\n\nTIMER 2 minutes: GRACE\n\nTIMER for 3 minutes discussion: GRACE\n\n\n\nRemember these strategies from the prework?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince traditional financial advice presumes kids, these strategies can help you acheive the life you want.\n\n\nYou can find this slide and information on the Figjam board here [show them where]\n\n\n\n(1 minute)\n\n\n\nAs a childfree person, is there one or two philosophies  in particular that would help you achieve your ideal childfree life? How would it help you?  Let's take 2 minutes silently to think about this, and then we'll come back together.\n\n\n\nTIMER 2 minutes: GRACE\n\nTIMER 5 min for discussion: Grace\n\nLet's discuss.  What do you think?  Is there one that attracts you more than other?  How do you think these philosophies would help with people who have chosen to be childfree? \n\n\n\nThese philosophies help us to be really intentional about realizing our ultimate lives, since financial advice based on traditional life scripts do not apply to us.\n\n\n\nWe hope you are seeing that some of the subtlties of finding financial advice and being childfree.  You have to really be intentional, and think through it.  You have to really make sure it applies to you.\n\n\n\nGreat work all!  Now, let's jump head and get to the good stuff!  You've thought about what you really want in life, and how you want to live your life.  You've researched and you've  financially planned for your non-traditional life. You figured out your own financial philosophy for what works.\n\n\n\nNow, let's go a step further and think about how to maximize the enjoyment of our money. Let's now take a topic that we recently shared in Paven: Money Dials.  How do you think this poll  came across to the Childfree? \n\nWho wants to share a brief summary about Money Dials?\n\n\n\n(1 minute) \n\n\n\nThe May poll was on Ramit Sethi's money dials, the 10 things people most commonly spend money on. To Sethi, since we spend money on what we love, these dials represent what matters most to someone.\n\n\n\nWhat would your top 1-2 money dials be as a childfree person?   What are some example expenditures you might have? \n\nWe'll give you 2 minutes silently, and then come together to share.\n\nTIMER 2 minutes: GRACE\n\n\n\nWhat were some of your responses?\n\nTIMER 3 minutes: GRACE\n\n\n\nCongrats!

We just finished our last dive into the childfree---let me recap for you...\n\nBecause being childfree doesn't follow a traditional life script, you may experience some pitfalls and pushback unique to the childfree. \n\nSome may unfairly judge you. They literally may not realize that they are judging you by the standards of a traditional life script. \n\nSome of these assumptions, like thinking you have lots of time and can care for sick or elderly relatives are particularly unfair to the childfree and can cause significant financial burdens.  These financial burdens can spiral on to you, if they don' t have their money affairs in order. \n\nBecause life keeps happening, and our own preferences change, the childfree will need to continue to evaluate, self-reflect and adjust their financial plans throughout life\n\n\nLet's now follow the dotted line to reflect again...\n\n\n(12:52pm EST) haila: REFLECTION AFTER IMMERSION THREE, LAST REFLECTION 5 MIN\n\n\n\nLet's take a moment for you to reflect individually on the activity we just walked through\n\nIn FIgjam, please take 2 minutes for you reflect on the prompts below.\n\nTIMER 2 minutes: SCOTTY\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the one thing you want to remember from this activity?\n\n\n\nOptional questions (not on board) \n\nWhat is something you already knew?\n\nWhat is something that surprised you? \n\n\n\n(1 minute)\n\nNow, let's take another 2 minutes to brainstorm together how this might work with Paven\n\n\nWhat existing Paven articles come to mind that could be relevant to this Childfree segment?\n\nWhat new topics might be good for Childfree? \n\n\n\nTIMER 2 minutes: SCOTTY\n\n\n\n\n\nGRACE TO LINGER ON BOARD TO CLUSTER NEW TOPICS\n\n\n\nDAY 2\n\n:00 -:05 allowance for latecomers, bring back to childfree word, review board\n\n\n\nWelcome back!    \n\n\n\nAs folks are trickling in: \n\nHere is the board link: https://www.figma.com/board/FRZLfQT0O30SwBsaSIzIc6/Metamate-research?node-id=660-2074\n\nPlease go back to the one word synopsis you came up with to remind you of everything childfree.

Today, we're going to thinking about how to apply this to Paven.  Specifically, we'll be prioritizing and selecting topics for Q3.   \n\n\n\n(Pull everyone to this board: https://www.figma.com/board/FRZLfQT0O30SwBsaSIzIc6/Metamate-research?node-id=660-2134&t=M9I5zGyyTiXUebwb-4 )\n\nWe're going to put some time on the clock for you all to review the topics on the board. As you can see, we've clustered your brainstormed topics to streamline this activity. As we move forward with the voting, consider each cluster a 'topic'.\n\nWith your childfree hat on, think through which of these topics are most helpful for me as a childfree person.\n\n\n\nTIMER 2-3 minutes: SCOTTY\n\n\n\n:10 -:55 PRIORITIZATION AND SELECTION ACTIVITY\n\n\n\n:10 -:12  | 2 minutes: Instructions\n\nHere's what's happening today.  We're voting for topics on the New Topics board only, and we're going to discuss the top voted topics to select one for July, one for August, and one for September. \n\nAnd we're going to vote with the childfree mindset. 'Which of these topics is most helpful for me as a childfree person?'\n\nNow for how this will work. You each get 6 votes. You can only vote on each topic once.  When voting for a clustered topic, please vote for the rectangle around the cluster. \n\nHere are the stamps.  This is just like the Q3 Content Planning we did with Angie.  Your votes are hidden until the voting session ends. You can use any stamp for voting.\n\nWe're going to set the clock for 3 minutes.  \n\n:12 - :15 | 3 minutes: Vote\n\n:15 - :25  |  2-10 minutes: Tabulation and Re-vote if needed\n\nVote tool will count and tell us which ones have the most.\n\nLook to see any topics with 3 or more.\nIf do not have 8 amount of topics with 3 or more, need a second round of voting \n\nAny topics with 3 or more votes will be moved to another location.\n\nTurn all the ones that got no votes into GRAY post-its. \n\n(if needed) We're going to vote one more time.  Everyone has 3 votes.  \n\nEach of you in this next round will get 3 votes to distribute amongst the remaining topics (that originally got 1-2 votes each).   Do not vote for any gray topics.\n\nYou'll have another 2 minutes to vote, starting NOW! \n\nTimer: 2 minutes\n\n\n\nRepeat this process until we get to 8.\n\n5 min buffer\n\n:30 - :55 | 25 minute voting prioritization discussion\n\nShow new board with topics...\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You have now ranked the new article topics in terms of helpfulness to the childfree, identifying the top 8. As we've mentioned, our end goal is deciding article topics for the Q3 calendar.\n\nIn deciding those Q3 topics, we are asking you to consider the following criteria:\n\nDoes this topic set us up to do one of the following: take action with a benefit provider, AND/OR take action with another Paven tool or feature (e.g. goals, another article)?\n\nDoes the topic fit with the monthly theme for July, August or September? Which are true/easy fits vs. which ones would require a bit more effort to connect to the monthly theme? \n\nIs the topic relevant only for the childfree segment? Or is it a more broadly relevant topic that will require a particular childfree spin?\n\n\n\nLet's spend 5 minutes quietly to think through the criteria as it relates to these topics.  Please formulate your own opinions as to which topics you would slate for Q3. \n\n\n\nAt the end of the 5 minutes, we will begin a discussion to align as a group on which topics to choose for the Q3 calendar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:55 haila: WRAP UP 5 MIN\n\n\n\nFinal Reflection (2-3 min)\nThanks You's / Brief Recap of Session / Celebration (1 min)\nNext steps (30 sec)\nAngie's Closing Remarks (30 sec)\n\n\n\nFinal Individual Reflection  3 min\n\n\n[1 min]\n\nWe are almost at the end of our time together and we have truly created a magical space for co-creating insights and implications. \n\n\n\nBefore we go to our next meeting or start responding to the chats/emails, I want to gift you space for  some final reflection on what emerged for you from our working session today and yesterday. \n\n\n\n[if have time OR feel like it's needed] To do that, I want us to shake off our childree mindset that you ahve been holding for the session and come back to you, rockstar content strategist for Paven.

So thank YOU for letting us be a part of that.\n\n\n\nNext Steps \n\n[1 min]\nIn terms of next steps, content can now take the identified  topics and work them into the content calendar for Q3 and beyond, using the topic backlog.\n\nYou will all have access to this board for reference \u2013 includes prework/summary of the research and space for the sources to date . And this is your board, please add any additional sources of information that you find useful for this segment that all of us can benefit from. \n\n\nAnd of course, as we publish these articles, we would like to monitor new users and repeat users engagement to both identify and nurture this 'childfree' segment within our user base, as well as continue to learn what resonates (or not) with them\n\nThis our first type of session like this with you all, would love to get your feedback.

The message from the firings was clear: Get in line with our policies, or get out.\n\nBetrayed: supposed to feel secure, in control and instead feel stress, loss of autotomy and survival mode\n\n\"'I feel so betrayed.' That's something that I hear over and over again,\" said Ling Lam, an engineer turned psychologist who lectures at Santa Clara University and provided on-site counseling at Google for 14 years. \"This all creates uncertainty, which is a huge stressor for the body.

While 57% of employees cited wanting better benefits, only 13% admitted that they had made a career transition. The report also found that 35% of workers felt stuck at their current job because they were afraid of taking a pay cut and 34% were worried about financial instability during the transition.'\n\nAFRAID TO LEAVE MONEY ON THE TABLE\n\n\"He is not sure if he wants to stay, but isn't looking elsewhere for at least six months because he'd be leaving money on the table. \"I have lots of shares that are vesting,\" he said. \"I might consider working somewhere else when they do.\"\n\nPerceived sense of that some may be unlike other techies  which further limits their choices\n\n\"Billy has a decade of experience at blue-chip companies but said he's been job hunting for a year. Last month he interviewed at Uber, only to be rejected and find the role relisted at a lower pay bracket. \"It was a bitter pill to even apply there because of their labor practices and wage discrimination,\" he said, referring to accusations against the company. He has tried to \"avoid companies that don't align with me morally,\" but he's getting desperate.  It doesn't help that many people assume that privileged techies have it easy. \"A lot of tech people are shitheads, and their problems are absolutely first-world. \u2026 If they ended up jobless tomorrow, [they] would land on their feet,\" said Billy. \"But I'm from the middle of nowhere, West Virginia. I have six figures of student loan debt. If I run out of savings, I'm on the street. I hope that we can find some common empathy for everybody.\"\n\nUNIQUE TECH COMPANY RELATED FINANCIAL CHALLENGES\n\nFront loaded earnings:  meaning, earnings will tend to grow less quickly than others\n\nManaging a volatile industry\n\nTechnology firms hire and lay workers off routinely, especially as they are often heavily financed by debt and investment. A good advisor can help you prepare for the ups-and-downs that come with this kind of career.\n\nCommon for tech workers to freelance or contract\n\n\"Yet the financial profile of this kind of work is very different from that of a W-2 employee. You need to prepare for funding your own health insurance and retirement accounts, as well as the feast and famine nature of self-employment and all of the expenses associated with it. A financial advisor who has experience working with your industry can help you consider all that.\"\n\nStock options and benefits \n\nLimiting risk by knowing how much to keep in concentrated company stock vs tax burden if you sell\n\n\"One of the biggest financial planning challenges for Silicon Valley and tech executives is sizing up risk, according to Dave Alison, president and founding partner of Prosperity Capital Advisors. More specifically, determining how much of their net worth they should keep in concentrated company stock and understanding the tax implications of selling to lower their risk.\"\n\nEnsuring you've withheld sufficient taxes from stock based compensaton\n\nFor the public traded company executives, the most acute challenges are managing their stock-based compensation to make sure sufficient taxes are being withheld or they have a plan to pay what is owed, said Tony Blagrove, CEO and founder of Traveka Wealth. Otherwise, Blagrove said they could be surprised by an unexpectedly large tax bill and need to scramble to find the money to pay for it - an unnecessary yet fairly common occurrence.\n\nHow to weigh private company equity tax, liquidity and potential stock option success\n\n\"Ultimately, the key lesson is that concentration can make you rich, but diversification can keep you rich.\"\n\nEducaton on components of equity compensation including related tax treatments\n\nFinally, outside of educating clients on the alphabet soup of RSUs, RSAs, ISOs, and NQSOs that might make up their equity compensation, Joe Lum, regional president of MAI Capital Management, said it's important to understand the tax treatment of each vehicle and the timing of when the tax liability is owed.\n\n\"For an executive at a publicly traded company, it is common for the income tax for vested RSUs to be withheld at the federal supplemental tax rate, generally around 22 percent, which is likely much lower than the effective tax rate. Without proper cash flow planning, this can cause an unwelcome surprise come April 15 or even underpayment penalties,\" Lum said. \n\nYear-round tax planning can help avoid this pitfall by understanding the vesting schedule of all equity compensation and reviewing the client's paystub on an ongoing basis and adjusting withholdings if necessary, Lum said."}{"name": "Secondary and Proxy Primary Research Possiblities.docx", "content_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "size": 123987, "data": {}, "collection_name": "52d49398-9945-4c73-ab66-70d7e31e33e6"}nullhá˙≥zmmom43  hxA@        UUÅCÅiÅƒaÉGhá˙˙df36b344-b3c8-4aba-b056-6ede46f97b5da54e815a-10d9-434a-bfda-d1aa9015facbc185a69e0026a725526f327ed96a3b11fe44e7340e318f365aae09854a817f3bChildfree x Meta FINAL.pptx/Users/287096/open-webui/backend/data/uploads/df36b344-b3c8-4aba-b056-6ede46f97b5d_Childfree x Meta FINAL.pptx{"content": "A growing segment\n\nChildfree\n\nand \n\n\n\nComing attractions\n\nplan\n\nChildfree: a high potential Paven segment\n\nThe Childfree Mindset\n\nPut in story beats\n\nRefine content within story beats\n\nMake visual design uniform\n\nClean up charts (might happen when share with others)\n\nProof\n\nShare with others to for their inputs\n\nTraditional financial advice does not consider the Childfree\n\nPaven is set up to serve the Childfree\n\n7/23/25\n\n2\n\n\n\nChildfree: high potential Paven segment\n\n\n\nAs we evolved our understanding of the 2018 research...\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe noticed\u2026\n\nLower engagement with kid-focused content\n\nHigher engagement with lifestyle focused content \n\nPush notifications\n\n2H24 standout content\n\n1 High Earner, Not Rich Yet 305 reads 2 Meta Benefit updates for 2024 303 reads 3 Your RSUs: Taxes on restricted stock units 213 reads 4 Get tax guidance with Financial Finesse 212 reads 5 Meta's 401(k) match in 2025 207 reads 6 Travel benefits with Meta 204 reads 7 Dual income, no kids 139 reads 8 Planning for retirement beyond your 401(k) 109 reads 9 Meta's flexible savings account 103 reads 10 Your RSUs: Basics of restricted stock units 99 reads\n\nTOP pushes in 2H24 LOWEST pushes in 2H24 1 RSU basics 1 Talking Money With Your Kids 2 FSA use it or lose it 2 Meta FSA 3 Winter Travel 3 Back to School 4 HENRYs 4 Breastfeeding Benefits\n\nLeast popular goal \u200b\n\nKid's education\n\nLower journey engagement\n\nPlanning for a Baby\n\nRaising Kids\n\nCaring for your Family\n\n\n\nOur newly launched Profile Builder is already yielding significant insights\n\n68% no kidsof those who filled out the Profile Builder\n\nProfile & Onboarding\n\nEnhancements April '25\n\n6\n\n\n\n2024 Pew research into childfree adults 18-49\n\n47%\n\n US Adults stated unlikely to have children\n\n\n\nOUR HYPOTHESIS\n\nA high likelihood of Paven eligible users are likely to be childfree\n\n~56k\n\nCurrent FTEs in US eligible for Paven\n\n~25k +\n\nCurrent FTEs childfree\n\n12k\n\nCurrent Paven users (21% of total FTEs)\n\n~5.6k \n\nCurrent Paven users with no kids\n\nConservative assumption: \n\n47% \u200bof US adults 18-49(Pew 2024)\u200b\n\n\n\nThe Childfree Mindset\n\n\n\nThe Childfree are\u00a0a growing phenomenon that is here to stay\n\nSource: \"The Experiences of US Adults Who Don't Have Children\" (Pew, 2024) \n\n\n\nWhere is this coming from?   \n\nThe Childfree\n\nMostly millennials\n\n\ud83e\uddd0 Biggest pain point: first generation who don't have it better than their parents\n\nMINDSET\n\nBeing childfree is a decision, a lifestyle and a strategy\n\nIt's about (survival and) living the life you want, on your own terms\n\n\n\nChildfree is a decision \n\nMINDSET\n\n\"Once a parent, always a parent.

Understand where I am at, by knowing where I'm coming from\n\n2. Help me defeat the 'Overwhelm Paralysis'\n\n3. Help me avoid the 'Figuring it out Fatigue'\n\nComing from a diverse background, employees bring their own unique baggage when approaching financial decisions. This manifests via barriers to even seek support: \"feeling shame/regret\", \"feeling alone\" and \"running away from it\"\n\nWhen unlocking new financial possibilities (for instance, when joining FB), our people get overwhelmed with too many unfamiliar decisions upfront. They are unable to navigate through the noise, falling into limbo and letting other priorities take precedence.\n\nIn their daily lives and work, our people experience \"figuring it out fatigue\", forcing them to prioritize. As a result, finance ends up taking a back seat. When they do try learning/ acting on their financial goals, they get sucked into complicated \"rabbit holes\" without a clear path or outcome in sight.\n\nThe finance monster\n\nFacing an unfamiliar totem pole\n\nGoing into rabbit holes\n\n\"I've had some conversations with members of the Black@ group and a lot of us have like the same financial guidance growing up, which is very little. You grow up in situations where parents either don't talk about money or it's a taboo to talk about money, and then you end up working for this companies and then before you know it you're at the bottom portion of a totem pole that you didn't even know existed.\"\n\n\"This engineer from Eastern Europe was like, \"I have so much money and I don't know what to do with it.\" And I was like, 'I'm in a totally different place. I'm so scared right now'. My finances are really bad\u2026 If I was doing okay, I'd be like, \"OK I'll talk about it.\" Because I'm not in really good space it's kind of embarrassing to talk about.\"\n\n\"I get really exhausted thinking about having to learn how to do my job and then I need to think about finances. I'm just having learning fatigue, I need to take a step back and bucket these things, compartmentalize them. I tend to leave finances to the end; I usually focus on work, health and personal well-being and then finances.\"\n\nConfidential and proprietary \u00a9 2020 Round Feather, Inc.\n\n\n\nWho I am\n\nSummary: key insights from the user journey map\n\n4. Help me balance my conflicting priorities\n\n5. Help me engage with true belonging\n\n6. Help me build resilience as I correct my course and figure out my next big move\n\nAs our young workforce transitions from the \"me\" to \"we\" stage in life, they need to juggle and prioritize against new goals. There is a feeling of being judged instead of feeling supported for the decisions they make, as life starts to gain more definition. \n\nA fundamental barrier to engagement is the inability to truly resonate with the communication around our benefits. The frustration of not being able to show their authentic self prevents them from engaging both one-on-one and in communities.\n\nWhen our people reflect on and re-evaluate their priorities at work and life, they are conflicted between making the next big move while not falling behind where they are. This also manifests in wanting to foster resilience in their kids, learnt and built from their own life experiences.\n\nColor-blocking priorities\n\nCode-switching to engage\n\nBuilding resilience while charting my course\n\n\"It talked to a Charles Schwab advisor, but she was hard to understand, like jargon and also a little judgy... I told her 'I want to buy a house' and she said 'How is your budget? What is your spend amount? I don't think you're ready to buy a house, I think you could have done a better job at it.' It should have been like 'I love that you are trying to buy a house. I think this is a perfect idea, if that's what your life goal is let's work towards that.\"\n\n\"How do I bring my authentic self when it's actually a very unique self to what you'll often find as the norm? What works for me in terms of what I need for financial wellness and literacy is not what is being offered as the standard program. But how do I find that if I'm only the 3% in the company? We're all individuals with our own stuff. So, building on a system that can take all these parameters and spit something out for someone, let alone give options... It's hard.'\n\n\"I'm at a phase right now where I look back at these milestones or major moments and wonder 'What's next? What's going to be my next sort of breakthrough where I can expand my mind and my skills?.' I'm at a sort of precipice right now, open to it and ready to see what this next wave could be but I'm also at that life stage where I've got two kids, a wife\u2026 How much disruption do I really need?.\"\n\nConfidential and proprietary \u00a9 2020 Round Feather, Inc.\n\n\n\nWho I am\n\nKey takeaway\n\nKnow me where I am coming from\n\nMeet me where I am at\n\nConfidential and proprietary \u00a9 2020 Round Feather, Inc.\n\n\n\nWho I am\n\nMapping users  financial journey through key moments that matter \n\nIn the latest research we identified that there are key moments in the users' life that are the triggers or receptivity moments for major financial decisions and actions. \n\nLife lessons shape philosophy and values \u2013 provide context to motivation and urgency of users as they engage in their finances: \n\nThese are moments that help shape user's philosophy and values toward money usually set by early influences from the family and loved ones. It is important to know this to understand the motivations and urgency users have toward achieving financial well-being\n\nUsers move from a me-to-we mindset as their financial priorities change through key life and work moments\n\nThe life moments present here can range from personal to work related but encompass a transition point as users' goals and major life decisions are prioritized based on a changing focus from oneself to focusing on people in their care circle. \n\nConfidential and proprietary \u00a9 2020 Round Feather, Inc.\n\n\n\nWho I am\n\nKey takeaway\n\nTrue financial well-being can be achieved by \n\nLife lessons, philosophy, values \n\nMoments that matter\n\nCompeting goals\n\nDefine where they want to go and take action\n\nSetting goals help users take realistic steps that addresses their competing priorities and not in isolation but holistically.\n\nKnowing where users are coming from \n\nUsers have different starting points.

Based on user feedback, following are the key attributes that determine engagement from users. \n\nRelatable & Empowering\n\n\"Looking at him and thinking: 'That's what we want in life'. He is where we wanted to be and so his advice landed probably a bit better because of that. He was where we were in terms of tech, at a young age, and then at his age he is where we wanted to be. So, he must be doing something right. I may be overvaluing Scuba Matt but he's left a positive, long term impression on me.\"\n\nJargonized\n\n \"I have all these dozen examples like I've been in situations where people immediately started talking about: 'This is why I want to get into finances', they already started throwing terms at me and I was like 'I have no idea what are you talking about'.

OK.\nAny quick questions before we dive right in?\n\n\nAlison   0:12\nNo, I'm excited to do this.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   0:14\nAwesome, great. Yay.\nOh, happy to hear that.\nSo to start off, just kind of a a little ice breaker. What is your official role at at Meta?\n\n\nAlison   0:26\nYeah, I'm a technical recruiter. I've been with meta for nine years.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   0:30\nAwesome. 09 years. Wow, that's awesome.\n\n\nAlison   0:32\nYeah, that's well.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   0:34\nIf you could so you could.\nKind of like very briefly, like in a few words, kind of like your major responsibilities in this technical recruiter role.\nWhat would you say those are?\n\n\nAlison   0:47\nI basically hire folks to work in our data center strategy and sustainably in Net Zero team.\nSo my role is to ultimately I'm kind of the closer, so I chat with folks at the full loop stage and and if we get to offer then ioffer them the job and negotiate and get them to start at meta.\nSo that's the layman, probably in terms of the role, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   1:09\nI see.\nMakes sense. Makes sense.\n\n\nAlison   1:12\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   1:13\nI am following.\nOK, awesome. And then kind of zooming out a little bit in terms of, you know, Pavan really an app centred on finances and benefits.\nSo what would you say are your kind of main financial priorities at the moment?\nWhat's really top of mind for you right now?\n\n\nAlison   1:35\nYeah.\nReally, it's about probably saving for some house upgrades and also just prioritizing lifestyle as I just had a kid last year.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   1:47\nCongratulations.\n\n\nAlison   1:48\nThank you.\nYeah. So we we have the 529, but I think it's more of just thinking through our our long term plan for being a family, you know and and think about financial aspects and that and how our budget changes.\nBut I think really the specific is just saving.\nSome cash for home projects.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:09\nGotcha. Gotcha.\nAwesome. What kind of home projects are you hoping to do? If you don't me asking?\n\n\nAlison   2:13\nWe we have to get our roof.\nWell, we've gotten the roof budget done.\nSo that's gonna be done.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:17\nOK. Gotcha. My parents just went through that themselves.\n\n\nAlison   2:18\nYeah, really excited about that goal.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:22\nYeah, I remember that.\n\n\nAlison   2:22\nYeah.\nSo yeah, we got that budget done.\nReally, it's about remodeling our master bathroom.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:30\nOK.\n\n\nAlison   2:31\nTrying to make it that we don't go into debt for anything and that's important thing. And just in general.\nBut yeah, like probably in about 5 years remodeling our master bathroom.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:42\nGotcha. Nice.\nNice. OK.\nSo like you're you're budgeting it out, you're planning when it can happen.\nThat sort of thing, OK.\n\n\nAlison   2:48\nYeah, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:49\nNice, smart, smart.\nI got all things for me to keep in mind.\n\n\nAlison   2:53\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:56\nAnd you know of, I assume that your financial priorities have kind of changed a bit over the years. So kind of from when you first started at meta to now, how have those priorities shifted?\n\n\nAlison   3:10\nOh my God, it's so crazy.\nSo, you know, I think before meta, you know I had a 401K and I had that from previous employers had always been focused on that from when I was like 20 years old.\nLike, thank God, my dad like told me to invest a far one case.\nSo I always had the retirement fund.\nI wanna say that it was probably closer to 20-19, maybe 2020 when I started. Like really think through.\nInvesting outside of my retirement fund.\nYou know, I had met my husband, now husband at that around that time and it was thinking through like couple.\nConversations around finances and then in 2021 we were looking at buying a house and it was just kind of like, honestly, it was more just luck of the draw that I hadn't sold any meta stock that like, helped us with our down payment. And so that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   4:00\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   4:03\nWas interesting 'cause.\nThat definitely helped.\nBut then when I look back on it, I'm thinking about like taxes then and I started looking into like.\nMy RSU tags and how it's taxed as income and you know, as a recruiter I have those conversations with candidates, but I don't think it was until that time that I really kind of was deep diving into how I think about leveraging my Rs use.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   4:23\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   4:23\nThe past few years, it's been more about since we've we bought the house.\nIt it's it's funny to think back on like your timeline, but I think now it's like really it was building the emergency fund and emergency fund in line with repairing a roof.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   4:38\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   4:40\nSo it was a lot more cash heavy focus there the past year or so. And now I think priority is stacking cash, but like less more so as an emergency fund since I feel like we have a pretty solid emergency fund set up.\nLike probably about six months in cash to keep us good.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   4:59\nOh wow, that's awesome.\n\n\nAlison   5:00\nYeah, and like and that's it's been.\nIt's it's fascinating to me, 'cause. I like think back and I was not in that mindset nine years ago.\nLike it's just and Paven has definitely helped me with different areas, but yeah, so that's kind of where we're at now.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   5:07\nYeah.\n\n\nAlison   5:12\nSo I feel like we've got a pretty good like nest egg and I think now it's like being intentional around spending and thinking through like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   5:13\nMm hmm.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   5:22\nI mean, honestly, I work for meta, but like my outside of work. Like when do I get to like, retire early?\nType not like full fire movement, which I'm sure you've heard, but like just like a little bit of like time flexibility like this.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   5:31\nYep, Yep.\n\n\nAlison   5:36\nBeen with my son, so focusing more on that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   5:38\nMm hmm.\nGotcha. Gotcha. OK. Yeah, so lots.\nWhich, you know, makes sense.\nLots of devolved over the years.\nBut all very important stuff.\nI think so.\nWhen I say the term financial well-being.\nWhat does that mean to you?\nWhat does that look like for you?\n\n\nAlison   6:02\nYeah, I mean it.\nThat feels good.\nLike in first I feel like I have a good financial well-being.\nWhat I think through that is that I we never we don't have any debt outside of our mortgage and that was a really big picture for us.\nOh, paying off, my son. My husband's student loans last year was also a focus.\nSo I think you know, I think having no debt besides the mortgage is a big one.\nI think that being able to know that if something were to happen, because that's a reality for us, like we'd be able to be OK for a couple of months from a financial perspective.\nAnd I think time freedom is kind of important to me.\nAnd like I'm, I'm grateful to have the job, but I think long term being able to have enough financial stability that I could walk away for an extended period of time before finding something else. And that's like a five year six year plan.\nSo don't tell my meta managers that that's on the horizon, but yeah, but that's kind of how I think about it.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   7:03\nNo, of course your secret is safe with me.\n\n\nAlison   7:05\nYeah, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   7:06\nYep. Yep, Yep. OK. OK.\nThat's awesome. Great.\nAnd.\nYou know, how have you sort of?\nKind of gotten to this place of like feeling in really good shape when it comes to financial well-being.\n\n\nAlison   7:23\nHigh income increased and you know I was promoted and I started to you know I was getting, I got married in 2022. So you know, when I met my husband, it was like we're a very different financial experiences. And so I think like coming together early.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   7:25\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   7:39\nOn about what that looked like, combining finances like budgeting appropriately, I still don't think like we budget well, but thankfully like we have enough cash. So we can like play around with things on a monthly basis and like I feel really grateful for that.\nBut it's not something that I hold like really stringent to.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   7:56\nYep, Yep.\n\n\nAlison   7:57\nAnd so I think that's a big one in terms of like my income is definitely increased.\nI've got promoted twice and I think be really intentional about like where my paycheck goes in terms of like it goes to like 5 different accounts.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   8:12\nYeah.\n\n\nAlison   8:13\nLike three of them are savings accounts like what we call, what we call the sinking funds, right?\nLike travel, the bathroom remodel like, and I've been really intentional about that.\nI wanna say the past like.\nTwo to three years.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   8:24\nGotcha. Gotcha.\nOK.\nThat's awesome.\nAnd then kind of on the the flip side of of what paven kind of tackles being, but still kind of tied being benefits?\nI assume as a recruiter you might have a little bit of a better kind of understanding of the benefit landscape. Would you say that's accurate?\n\n\nAlison   8:44\nYeah.\nDefinitely.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   8:47\nYep, Yep.\nAnd So what are some of the, I guess, thinking about how it ties to your financial well-being as well?\nLike what are some of kind of the top meta benefits that you utilize?\nThat really help you there.\n\n\nAlison   9:01\nYeah, I mean, we used the.\nProgeny benefit to have our child. I use Cleo regularly in his first year of life.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   9:07\nOK. Yep.\n\n\nAlison   9:13\nI had a career coach with Lyra for a little bit over a year.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   9:17\nThanks.\n\n\nAlison   9:20\nI think that was like those are the main ones from a benefit perspective. I mean like the the well-being, the Wellness benefit, the $2000 that we give like that's.\nThis kind of range like I've used it for like my dog's daycare and then like I bought a kayak like now I'm using it for like my son's museum like, you know, so like, I feel like that's a good benefit. But like, it's just something that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   9:38\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   9:41\nKind of fluid, but yeah, the being able to have our son be IVF and progeny was huge.\nAnd Clio was huge in the past year of just like motherhood. So.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   9:47\nMm hmm.\nYes, right. Yeah.\nThat's awesome.\nThat's awesome.\nThat's some great benefits.\nI was actually.\nWe were doing a push the other day for it the the Lyra benefit.\nEffort I believe.\nSo I was reading more about that and I was like, oh, very nice, nice.\n\n\nAlison   10:03\nYeah, it's, it's great.\nYeah, I always thought of it as like it's therapy.\nBut then when?\nI like went because I I didn't feel like I needed therapy.\nThen this was a couple years ago. Like I didn't feel like I had childhood trauma to work through.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:12\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   10:16\nBut then I was like, OK, let me see, you know, like, we're going through this like IVF and like, trying to figure out stuff with my husband. And like, this is an interesting time.\nSo when I signed up, it was like therapy or career coaching or like life coaching. And I was like.\nLife coaching like I didn't know there was a benefit, but that's awesome.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:29\nThat, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   10:31\nLike that's kind of how I'm thinking about this.\nAnd I was with her for about a year and a half, and it was amazing. So.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:37\nAmazing, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   10:39\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:39\nYeah, that's really awesome.\nDefinitely like life coaching is something like even on my social media and everything like it's something that I'm seeing come up a lot more and I'm like, you know, there's something there.\n\n\nAlison   10:46\nYeah, people need it.\nPeople need it, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:47\nI think, yeah.\nAwesome. OK.\nGreat, so now I kinda wanna spend the rest of our time.\nKind of diving into the pavement app and your experience with it.\n\n\nAlison   10:58\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:59\nSo I guess to start, how long have you been using Pavan for?\n\n\nAlison   11:04\nI think they could have like a couple of like many years. Like I want to say at least six years.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   11:10\nGotcha. OK.\n\n\nAlison   11:11\nIf that makes sense, because I I think when I really started because like I'm not sure when like the fire movement for me started about, I feel like it was around 2020 or like seeing those types of things and it was like, oh, like I definitely Don.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   11:19\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   11:22\nThink I'm there, but like I'm interested in deep dive more into my finances and I think that I probably leveraged it more starting then and obviously a different goal.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   11:31\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   11:32\nSo that was interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   11:37\nSo.\nWhen you first started using Paven, what would you say?\nWere your expectations for the product and what it would, it would help you with and do for you?\n\n\nAlison   11:54\nI definitely.\nI definitely thought it was gonna be like more of a budgeting tool, and I don't think I'd ever use one.\nAnd I I remember that being really crystal clear when I jumped into it because the one thing that I did appreciate, it was the different articles that were in there and the way that they're situated is like kind of telling a story.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:08\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   12:13\nI really appreciated that and I remember just kind of like reading, like ferociously the different articles, even if I like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:16\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   12:21\nLike when I think back 2020, 2019-2020.\nI had no vision of buying a home, you know, and that wasn't even on my radar.\nAnd then it was, oh, this is interesting.\nLike there's an article around like what that might look like, or how we think about that. And so it I was pleasantly surprised by that in terms of the amount of information that was on there.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:41\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   12:42\nAnd you know, I saw the the goals that popped up and I I kinda played around with it, but I don't think that I really deep dived into that maybe until a couple years ago.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:53\nGotcha. Gotcha.\n\n\nAlison   12:54\nLike a year and a half ago.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:56\nSo what?\nWhat goal was it that a couple years ago that you started diving into more?\n\n\nAlison   13:01\nIt was probably the emergency fund and like buying a home.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   13:04\nGotcha. Mm hmm mm hmm.\nGotcha.\nSo.\nSo in AI, guess in that sense like it was.\nYou know, cuz we, you know, there is a budgeting tool in pavement, of course.\nBut there's also the articles as well.\nSo, like, how would you say like overall the app kind of aligns with your expectations or meets it or, you know, does something else?\n\n\nAlison   13:34\nYeah, the the last time I did want to touch on is I've talked to a coach multiple times and that is a huge benefit. Like I I'll typically start with the chat just because like I'm so busy that I'm just like, oh, I have a quick question like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   13:37\nMm hmm.\nOh, nice, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   13:47\nLet me just jump into the chat and the first time that I did that was probably about like two years ago and the guy was so nice.\nHe's like, do you wanna jump on a call?\nLike it just be more so much easier.\nAnd that was the first time I'd ever talked to a financial person.\nI don't know if they're called financial advisors, but like somebody that like had that type of mentality.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   14:01\nMm hmm.\nYes.\n\n\nAlison   14:06\nAnd I was just, you know, it was a little just kind of like, oh, my God, like, how do we have this benefit 'cause? It was the most fruitful conversation I'd ever had in terms of finances.\nAnd then.\nEarlier this year, as we were thinking about taxes, because last year was absolutely insane from an income perspective.\nAnd the stocks?\nI jumped on a call with a person and then she was amazing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   14:26\nMm H.\n\n\nAlison   14:30\nAnd then she said, you know, we could probably do this again in June. And like, you know, you're gonna like stack your 401K.\nK and like we had this plan. And so then we're meeting again in June and I was like, I don't even know this is an option like this is incredible. So.\nThat is actually probably like one of the biggest things that I love about the app is talking to folks.\nTo kinda go back to your question of how I look at the app now, it's tough for me because I think the feedback that I gave was that the goals are just out of line to what my goals are now.\nSo when I look at that, it's like the two things that are I'm like in there right now.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   14:59\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   15:03\nIt's like consider buying a home or pay off your bad debts.\nWell, I don't have I.\nI don't need either of those.\nAnd so it was just kind of like, why is that there?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   15:08\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   15:10\nLike it's not as relevant. I feel like it would be better if like.\nThere was a list of goals that you could just choose from it, and maybe that exists, but at first glance that's what I'm seeing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   15:18\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   15:20\nAnd so maybe if there was a way that I could be like already bought a home, you know, no debt or something like that to make it like a little bit more focused. That's kind of one thing that I'm looking at.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   15:30\nMm hmm.\nSo then what's like looking at kind of the slate of goals and thinking about where you are now?\nWhat are one or two goals that you would like to see added to the pavement that you could see yourself taking advantage of at this moment?\n\n\nAlison   15:55\nI don't.\nI don't know 'cause. I'm like. I'm like, looking at the life path, which I also really like 'cause. It was like a kind of like a check like box almost for me.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   15:59\nGotcha. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   16:05\nAnd that's I think where I kind of stopped because it was like starting with like hey, your age, like your path and then it's like consider buying a home.\nIt's like, well, I already did that.\nFill your emergency fund. OK, I already did that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   16:18\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   16:18\nMy retirement is like technically at risk from them, but like, I think I'm OK with what I have.\nWhen I think about it, like longevity, like maybe I could look into that but and then send your kid to college. And it's just like, well, I already have a 529, so.\nI don't know, and I think that's what, honestly, what I'm trying to figure out myself from, like a financial perspective like you know it's it's like a good problem to have and I'm grateful that I do. But I think that's a big thing for me is like, OK.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   16:41\nYeah, right.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   16:47\nWhat does this look like?\nAnd I think the other thing is the market is wild and we have to be realistic about that, so.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   16:53\nYep, Yep.\nThinking, I guess a little bit more.\nJust kind of like wishlist like in addition to what exists in the app now like.\nWhat's something that you would?\nLike either a feature that you would love to see from the app, or even more so like what would you need to sort of at this moment, increase your.\nEngagement with the app right now.\n\n\nAlison   17:30\nI think the Community aspect is something that I feel like I'm missing from an app perspective, and I maybe you've heard this, but at mehda there's a couple groups that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   17:33\nMeeting.\n\n\nAlison   17:41\nTalk about financials and like tax, we call it tax avoidance at meta like you know it's a it's a pretty bad title, but it's just it's a group that talks about financial specifics that is just kind of like how do you set yourself up for success and in.\nThat area, and it would be so interesting if, like, there was a community piece where.\nWas like people are kinda sharing ideas. Similarly are like asking questions and then being able to respond.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:04\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   18:07\nSimilarly to what we do internally in the group and it's like OK, well, that would be interesting if we could do that in the app and kind of like take it into that and then tie it back to your specific arena of like what is needed, I I.\nGuess I maybe in a it's been a while since I've actually like jumped into the app because I think it was probably about a maybe six months ago when I chatted with a lady, but then also it's just like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:27\nMm hmm.\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   18:31\nLike this isn't really giving me a lot of value because I've run all the articles and I feel like my goals are set.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:36\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   18:38\nI feel like we're in a good financial place, so it wasn't like I feel like I'd go to it anymore to learn.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:44\nMm H.\n\n\nAlison   18:44\nBecause I feel like I'm a lot more financially knowledgeable now and have haven't paid in, is definitely a piece of that. And also just like individual research.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:57\nSo Speaking of the community aspect, do you has paven ever come up in conversation with other metamates? Like is it something that you've ever talked about with other folks or?\n\n\nAlison   19:08\nI have absolutely pitched it like to my immediate team and nobody knew about it. And so I think that that was interesting. And so, you know, I think it was earlier this year we were talking about the tax piece and I know that there's another way of like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   19:15\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   19:23\nWe you can like schedule time like as a benefit for taxes, but the person that I talked to in the like the coach was actually really helpful and it was like a little bit less than like directness around like taxes. Like they were, they did.\nAll well, where it wasn't like they were touching other subjects, but I don't think you're allowed to. But. And then I went back to my team and I said 'cause, we were just talking about, like, how we have to pay all these taxes. And I was like you.\nGuys need to use him like it's amazing and like I would say that like 90% of my team hadn't heard about it or hadn't used it and like didn't know it existed and it was just kind of like surprising to me. And I think that's because I.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   19:57\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   20:02\nJust like.\nImmersed myself in this like financial freedom type worlds that I'm like, why wouldn't you be using that?\nMad. And so it was surprising, but I definitely think that was like the feedback that I got.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   20:09\nRight, right.\nOK. Interesting. Also like good to hear 'cause, at least from my perspective, it's kinda hard for me to tell like what exactly how it's coming up in conversation and that sort of thing.\nBut that's awesome and.\n\n\nAlison   20:24\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   20:29\nI so then come kind of coming back to the community aspect.\nLike what?\nI guess what would that kind of look like in your mind if you were kind of drawing that out? Like is it about kind of going through?\nSpecific tasks in Paven together being able to talk about it.\nIs it a sort of like pull scenario where you can see how other folks are responding to questions?\nIs it like actual groups of paven users where you can just talk to each other?\nWhat would that kind of look like for you?\n\n\nAlison   21:02\nI think it would be interesting because I think that where I see a black hole is one people just don't talk about finances, which is totally fine like you have to be like a certain person to like have these types of conversations. But I just would love to.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   21:10\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   21:16\nBe able to understand where my peers are at and like. Maybe it's not that like my direct peers, but it's like, hey, you're kind of in the same boat that I'm in.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   21:20\nMm.\n\n\nAlison   21:25\nWhat's your thought process?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   21:26\nYep, Yep.\n\n\nAlison   21:27\nAnd I've got like one to two friends that I have these types of conversations with.\nBut like.\nIt would be so interesting if I could like connect with somebody else. That's like in a similar boat. Like has a House, has a child like.\nIs working towards maybe financial freedom and like is thinking about what that might look like. And I think that the way that I'm always coming about stuff is I love to learn like I love to read and like understand and like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   21:50\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   21:52\nSo I'm just a total fly on the wall in these groups and like seeing these people talk about this crazy stuff like, you know, as a technical recruiter, I definitely get paid well.\nBut like it's different than like a software engineer at Meta.\nBut I'm. Oh, my God, that's fascinating.\nLike, wow, that situation. You know what I mean?\nSo I think that's where I'm kind of thinking about it.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   22:08\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   22:09\nIt, but I just feel like there's such an opportunity to, like, almost grow with peers knowing that you're like in a similar spot with your finances.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   22:16\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   22:21\nAnd that's a culture thing as well.\nSo I think that's kind of like where it's a little bit more difficult 'cause you have to like be open to those types of conversations which like I said, I'd like one to two friends.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   22:31\nYeah, this this community piece is definitely something that has been very, you know, interesting to us. And like we've been mulling it over for quite some time in terms in terms of like what that would look like in practice and how we'd be able to manage that. So.\nIt's nice to hear that.\nLike, that's also like something that you're looking for is like the ability to really connect with peers.\n\n\nAlison   22:49\nYeah, interesting.\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   22:53\nAlso.\nFor my next sorry, next question was So what other sort of financial products or services or like even like visiting websites or readings etc.\nLike what else is kind of in your ecosystem of tools?\nAnd then how does paven sort of fit into that landscape?\n\n\nAlison   23:21\nYeah, podcast.\nSo I listen to the buddy with Katie show and like religiously and also like read her newsletters.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   23:27\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   23:30\nAnother one is like Instagrams.\nIt's funny.\nI want to say like probably about three or four years ago, I was like, so heavily invested.\nI just like started following a lot of like money influencers and then as I started like learning and like understanding it was almost just like every was saying the same thing.\nAnd then it was like OK then like this person is just like not my vibe.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   23:52\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   23:56\nThis person is and so I think like I've been able to kind of pare it down to my name with Katie, I think has always been one for me and like her starting probably around twenty 20th and she also worked at Meta so.\nYeah. And then.\nFeeling financial freedom?\nIt was like money like Mallory, something I don't know.\nShe is a financial influencer, if that's what we're gonna call it.\nBut she also.\nHas really young kids and so she's kinda talking about the aspects of financial freedom with children and like spending within your values.\nAnd that was really interesting.\nSo I think for my social perspective, those two, the Fidelity newsletter actually sends out a lot of interesting information.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   24:38\nHmm.\n\n\nAlison   24:41\nAnd.\nNerd Wallet sends out some interesting information, except I think it's really annoying that they just like pitch credit cards.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   24:47\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   24:49\nEspecially cause like I don't like. I don't wanna have a lot of consumer debt.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   24:51\nYeah.\n\n\nAlison   24:53\nSo it's just kind of like this is just dumb, but from a research perspective it's nice, but I think those are the like main ones.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   25:00\nMm hmm. Gotcha. OK. Nice. Nice. Nice. OK, great.\nSo I guess kind of to like start kind of at least summing up that paven experience in terms of.\nLike over over the years, I guess. How?\nLike, what's kind of your cadence with going into paven?\nLike, how often have you been like logging into paven over the years? And obviously I, you know, I assume that there might be some fluctuations and changes in there as well.\n\n\nAlison   25:33\nI think I think it was when like something big was happening from a money perspective.\nSo I definitely think during tax season.\nI don't.\nI want it like I don't.\nI don't think this is the case and I'm like was it around Rs us like quarterly? I don't think so.\nI think being like taxes are a big one and then I think it was more probably like every six months, honestly now 'cause, it's just like I don't really.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   25:56\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   25:57\nI don't feel like I have a lot to go into the app to look for because I kind of like have a good sense of where I stand financially.\nSo I'm like, I don't know that I either like go and learn.\nSomething new.\nBecause that's kind of how I used in the past.\nOf like knowledge, right? So.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:13\nRight.\n\n\nAlison   26:16\nNow I'm like looking at it. And I'm like, oh, interesting. Like value based investing like finances, sustainable, like.\nBut I found out about that type of stuff actually from a podcast. That money with Katie did with like in their advisor. And so I'm like, OK, but that's not as relevant.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:26\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   26:29\nSo that's like my immediate reaction.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:32\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   26:33\nSo yeah, I definitely I think from a coaching like because I probably would be opening it to talk to a coach, it'd be around like tax season or like my husband and I kind of go through finances at the beginning of the year.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:40\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   26:43\nSo it's like, OK.\nLet me like check in and see if I can like bring anything more to the table based on conversations with Coach.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:50\nGotcha. Awesome.\nAnd but I guess when you were you when you first downloaded it, like you said about six years ago, I think and you were like starting to read out all those articles, was it more that you were going into paven and and sort of taking advantage of that?\n\n\nAlison   27:06\nYeah, yeah, totally.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:07\nThat type of content. OK, it's nice.\n\n\nAlison   27:09\nYeah, 'cause I was.\nIt was like something new and and it was. And there was always something that was like being posted that was like, oh, I didn't think about that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:12\nYeah.\n\n\nAlison   27:16\nLike, that's interesting. And like I think that's like how it has definitely differed now that I'm more financially savvy, so to speak that that's like why I don't probably use it as often as before.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:24\nMm hmm.\nAnd then So what would you say again?\nJust like kind of ranking a bit like, what would you say is the most useful piece of the pavement app for you?\n\n\nAlison   27:49\nProbably the explorer, because there's still like articles in there that I like. I'm interested in reading.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:52\nMm hmm.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   27:59\nBut it's not like I'm like, needing to go in there and like, learn now. But I think that's that's definitely looking at it now.\nI'm like, oh, it's interesting.\nIt's like more structured a little bit like it looks differently, but I did previously like and I don't when that updates care about like I just in real time kind of like OK.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   28:12\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   28:17\nThat's helpful because like some of those are not relevant to me, but like maybe I could learn more about side hustles even. I don't wanna have a side hustle.\nBut like you know what I mean? Like you can just be knowledgeable.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   28:26\nYeah. And then on the flip side, what would you say is the least kinda useful?\nPiece of it.\n\n\nAlison   28:34\nI don't wanna say it's the goal section 'cause. I think it's nice to have that visibility, but like I do feel like there's a way that like I could set up my goals differently and the life path I feel like just doesn't really do a lot for me.\nLike it's just, I don't know.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   28:54\nWould you say it's because it's like a lack of like ability to kind of individualize, personalized, almost what? Yeah.\n\n\nAlison   29:00\nKind of.\nYeah, I think I think so, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   29:05\nGotcha.\nOK.\nOK.\nAwesome. Really quickly, just to kind of wrap up, I was hoping to kind of go through some of the features within paven and just kind of rank on a scale of one to five like one being least valuable, 5 being most valuable, where you would rank these spec.\n\n\nAlison   29:21\nYes.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   29:29\nFeatures and as you go. Just kind of explain your reasoning out loud.\nAnd we'll go from there.\nThere. So let's start.\nWith.\nDrum roll.\nLet's start with articles.\nOn a scale of one to five, one least five most valuable, where would you put articles?\n\n\nAlison   29:51\nI'm at 5.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   29:53\nGotcha. OK.\nAnd what I guess kind of I 'cause I didn't ask you this point when you brought it up, but like what?\nReally strikes you about the articles in the way that Pavan presents the content.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   30:10\nI think it's like small pieces like it's almost like kind of a snapshot on some of them. And I kind of appreciated that.\nIt was like, hey, like this article is 3 minutes.\nLike OK, I have 3 minutes like let me just like dive into this and then it feels like it's like pretty interactive.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   30:21\nYep.\nRight.\n\n\nAlison   30:27\nI don't.\nMaybe it's the way that it's like visually.\nIt's it's not a ton of information.\nIt's not like I feel like I'm, like, reading this article that like, I'm like going through, which like I would digest that and I'd love that. But I feel like for this, it's like you just kind of scroll through.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   30:39\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   30:42\nAnd it's like seem less.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   30:44\nMm hmm. Yep, Yep. Yep for sure.\nOK. That's great to hear.\nAll right. Next let's say the the polls feature.\nSo where would you put from 1:00 to 5:00? The the polls feature?\n\n\nAlison   30:58\nThe polls feature.\nI don't think I knew that existed.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:00\nYes. Oh, the polls, OK.\nSo yeah, so I don't know. So in the.\nAs of January this year, we started sending out polls in the newsletter as well, but you can also take them in the app.\nSo I think our latest one is.\nIt should have an option to take the poll on the screen.\nLet me see if I can get to it. On my home screen, yes.\nSo if you like go to your home screen and maybe refresh it under your next steps.\nI think the first one is what's your money dial?\n\n\nAlison   31:39\nOh, OK, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:41\nYeah. And so you can take that poll.\nYeah. OK. All right.\n\n\nAlison   31:47\nThat's interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:48\nAnd we send out polls like once a month.\n\n\nAlison   31:48\nI kind of looked at that as like, oh, interesting. OK.\nYeah, I kind of looked at that of like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:52\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   31:55\nIt was just another like goal because there's a lot more of like setup goal and I'm like well, that's not relevant.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:59\nMm hmm. Yep.\n\n\nAlison   32:00\nSo I I don't think I deep dived into that, but that's interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:03\nOK. OK. Nice, nice.\nDo you think that that's a feature that you would explore more if, like a topic came through or that that kind of struck a chord with you?\n\n\nAlison   32:13\nYeah, I think so, for sure, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:17\nAlright, let's Speaking of goals, let's go to goals now. So on from 1:00 to 5:00.\n\n\nAlison   32:21\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:22\nWhere would you put that?\n\n\nAlison   32:24\nProbably like A2.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:26\nGotcha.\nGotcha. OK. And I know we've kind of talked about that.\nJust like again, not being as relevant for you and.\nYeah, like all the boxes kind of being checked.\n\n\nAlison   32:40\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:42\nAnd let's say the the connect with a coach feature.\n\n\nAlison   32:46\nFive whole heartedly.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:48\nMm hmm.\nAwesome love hearing about the great experiences that you've had with the with the coaches.\n\n\nAlison   32:55\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:55\nThat makes me very happy.\n\n\nAlison   32:56\nYeah, I was.\nI was scared to jump on the phone with the first person.\nHe's like, it's so much easier to talk over the phone. If I was chatted, I was like I'm over the phone.\nI was like, Oh my God. Like, how is this a benefit for us like?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:05\nMm.\n\n\nAlison   33:07\nAnd it was amazing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:08\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   33:08\nSo I've never done the tax.\nOh, that's actually maybe some feedback, like the tax specific educator.\nThere's never any options available, so just FYI.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:15\nYep.\nGotcha.\nGotcha. Good to know. Thank you.\nAnd so with the coaching thing like, is that something that you would have kind of? Is that something you could have seen yourself trying to kind of figure out and uncover within the meta landscape without paven or was it just like paven presented it to you you were?\nLike, oh, let me jump on this.\nAnd then it's like, oh, this is really nice.\n\n\nAlison   33:46\nI remember probably Paven presenting it via like one of the benefits updates like they may have done, like a they probably. I remember this they probably did like an event and they shared and I was just like this is amazing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:51\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   34:00\nI need to do this and this probably a little bit like about six years ago, so for however long.\nSo yeah, I think it would have been presented to me and then it actually took me a little bit to actually do the coach thing because I think that I there was a little bit of hesitation because I felt.\nIt wasn't set up with my finances.\nI don't wanna like bring attention to it.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:20\nYep, Yep.\n\n\nAlison   34:21\nAnd then it was like, oh wait, I feel better. Let's talk.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:24\nGotcha. OK, interesting.\nI know the feeling.\nSometimes I'm like even just with my sister.\n\n\nAlison   34:29\nYou're right.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:32\nSometimes 'cause we're kind of and I feel like opposite ends right now. And whenever I start talking, I'm like maybe I won't talk to you right now. That's great.\n\n\nAlison   34:41\nTotally.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:44\nOK, next.\nWhat about the the budget feature?\n\n\nAlison   34:50\nDidn't know it existed and had to find it, so I've never really used it.\nI also use a separate tool for budgeting outside of paven, so that is what is like my day-to-day, which is the copilot app.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   35:00\nHmm.\nGotcha. OK.\nYep.

Panelists participate via self -administered web surveys. \nPanelists who do not have internet access at home are provided with a tablet and wireless internet \nconnection. Interviews are conducted in both English and Spanish. The panel is being managed by \nIpsos . \nData in this report is drawn from ATP  Wave 147, which was conducted from April 29 to May 19, \n2024 , among a sample of U.S adults  who have never had children and are unlikely to have children \nin the future. The sample was comprised of 8,826 panelists who had previously indicated that they \ndid not have children and, for those under 50 years old, had also said they were unlikely to ha ve \nchildren in the future. At the start of the survey, respondents were screened and considered \neligible for inclusion if they co nfirmed that they had never been a parent or guardian to any \nchildren, living or deceased, including biological or adopted children. To be considered eligible, \nrespondents under 50 also had to say that they were not too or not at all likely to have childre n in \nthe future. Of the 7,304 respondents who completed the screening questions, there were 3,312 who \nwere eligible and went on to complete the full survey, including 1,779  respondents from the ATP \nand an additional 1,533  from Ipsos' KnowledgePanel (KP) . The survey has a response rate of 82 % \n(AAPOR RR3).6 The cumulative response rate accounting for nonresponse to the recruitment \nsurveys and attrition is 2%. The break -off rate among panelists who logged on to the survey and \ncompleted at least one item is 1%.  \nWeighting and analysis were performed separately for respondents ages 18 to 49 and those 50 and \nolder. The margin of sampling error for the sample of 770 respondents  ages 18 to 49  is plus or \nminus 5.3 percentage points.  The margin of sampling error for the sample of 2,542 respondents \nages 50 and older is plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.  \nPanel recruitment  \nThe ATP was created in 2014 , with the first cohort of panelists invited to join the panel at the end \nof a large, national, landline and cellphone random -digit dial  survey that was conducted in both \nEnglish and Spanish. Two additional recruitments were conducted using the same method in 2015 \n \n6 The response rate is calculated as the number of eligible completes over the sum of eligible completes, breakoffs and nonresp ondents, \nwhere it is estimated that 46% of nonrespondents would have been eligible if they responded. 43 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org and 2017 , respectively. Across these three surveys, a total of 19,718  adults were invited to join the \nATP , of whom  9,942  (50%) agreed to participate.  \nIn August 2018, the ATP switched from telephone to address -based  sampling (ABS) recruitment. \nA study cover letter and a pre -incentive  are mailed  to a stratified, random sample of households \nselected from the U.S. Postal Service's Delivery Sequence File. This Postal Service file has been \nestimated to cover as much as 98% of the population, although some studies suggest that the \ncoverage could be in the low 90% range.7 Within each sampled household, the adult with the next \nbirthday is asked to participate. Other details of the ABS recruitment protocol have changed over \ntime but are available upon request.8  \nWe have recruited a national \nsample of U.S. adults to the \nATP approximately once per \nyear since 2014. In some years, \nthe recruitment has included \nadditional efforts (known as an \n\"oversample\") to boost sample \nsize with underrepresented \ngroups. For example, Hispanic \nadults, Black adults and Asian \nadults were oversampled in \n2019, 2022 and 2023, \nrespectively.  \nAcross the six address -based \nrecruitments, a total of 23,862  \nadults were invited to join the \nATP, of whom 20,917  agreed to \njoin the panel and completed an \ninitial profile survey. Of the \n30,859  individuals who have ever joined the ATP, 11,897  remained active panelists and continued \nto receive survey invitations at the time this survey was conducted.  \n \n7 AAPOR Task Force on Address -based Sampling. 2016. \"AAPOR Report: Address -based Sampling .\" \n8 Email pewsurveys@pewresearch.org .

All active ATP members who previously said in Wave 133 (fielded in \nAugust 2023) that they did not currently have any children, including any living outside their \nhousehold, and w ere either 1) 18 to 49 years old and not too or not at all likely to have children in \nthe future , or 2) 50 yea rs old or older were invited to participate in this wave.  \nThe ATP was supplemented with oversamples of adults ages 50 and older who previously reported \nthat they did not currently have any children living either inside or outside of their household. \nInitially, an oversample composed of Hispanic, non -Hispanic Black and non -Hispanic Asian KP \npanelists and further stratified by gender was drawn, and a total of 242 were  invited to participate \nan initial soft launch. Because eligibility rates for this oversample were lower than anticipated, no \nadditional cases in this sample were invited. Instead, a new oversample \u2013 consisting of adults of \nany race, ages 50 and older and with no children, stratified by education and gender \u2013 was drawn. \nKnowledgePanel respondents in the final data include both those from the initial soft  launch and \nthe second oversample.  \nBecause the group of potentially eligible adults who were sampled is broader than the target \npopulation, respondents were asked screening questions at the beginning of the survey to confirm \ntheir eligibility. Respondents were only considered eligible if th ey said they had never been a \nparent or guardian to any children, living or deceased, including any biological or adopted \nchildren. Additionally, respondents who were under 50 years old were only considered eligible if \nthey also said they were not too like ly or not at all likely to have children in the future.  \nKP respondents who screened ineligible for the main survey were asked a subset of demographic \nquestions needed for weighting purposes and are only considered to have completed screening if \nthey answered both the screening and demographic question sets.  \nQuestionnaire development and testing  \nThe questionnaire was developed by Pew Research Center in consultation with Ipsos. The web \nprogram was rigorously tested on both PC and mobile devices by the Ipsos project management \nteam and Pew Research Center researchers. The Ipsos project management te am also populated 45 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org test data that was analyzed in SPSS to ensure the logic and randomizations were working as \nintended before launching the survey.  \nIncentives  \nAll respondents were offered a post -paid incentive for their participation. ATP r espondents could \nchoose to receive the post -paid incentive in the form of a check or a gift code to Amazon.com or \ncould choose to decline the incentive. Incentive amounts ranged from $5 to $15 depending on  \nwhether the respondent belongs to a part of the population that is harder or easier to reach . \nDifferential incentive amounts were designed to increase panel survey participation among groups \nthat traditionally have low survey  response propensities.  \nIpsos operates an ongoing modest incentive program for KnowledgePanel to encourage \nparticipation and create member loyalty. The incentive program includes special raffles and \nsweepstakes with both cash rewards and other prizes to be won.  Typically, panel m embers are \nassigned no more than one survey per week. On average, panel members complete two to three \nsurveys per month with durations of 10 to 15 minutes per survey. An additional incentive is usually \nprovided for longer surveys.  \nData collection protocol  \nThe data collection field period for this survey  was April 29 to May 19, 2024 . Postcard notifications \nwere mailed to a subset of  ATP panelists  with a known residential address  on April 29 .9  \nATP i nvitations were sent out in separate launches: soft launch and full launch. Sixty  ATP  \npanelists were included in the  first soft launch , which began with an initial invitation sent on April \n29. After reviewing the first soft launch, a minor change was made to the screening question \" Have \nyou ever been a parent or guardian to any children, living or deceased, including any biological or \nadopted children? \" The original question asked about \"legal\" guardianship and included a \nreference to stepchildren. Six ty panelists were included in the second soft launch, which began \nwith an initial invitation sent on May 2. The second soft launch confirmed that the updated \nprogram was working as it should . The ATP panelists chosen for both soft launch es were known \nresponders who had completed previous ATP surveys within one day of receiving their invitation. \nAll remaining English - and Spanish -speaking  sampled ATP panelists were included in the full \nlaunch and were sent an invitation on May 3 . \n \n9 Postcard notifications are sent to 1) panelists who have been provided with a tablet to take ATP surveys, 2) panelists who we re recruited \nwithin the last two years, and 3) panelists recruited prior to the last two years who opt to continue receiving postca rd notifications. 46 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org KP invitations were sent out in separate launches: soft launch and full launch. A total of 242 KP \npanelists were included in the first soft launch, which began with an initial invitation sent on April \n29. After the first soft launch, the same wording edit was made to the parental status screening \nquestion and the sample design for KP panelists was changed (refer to the Sample Design section). \nA total of 245 panelists were included in the second soft launc h, which began with an initial \ninvitation sent on May  9. The second soft launch confirmed that the  updated  program was working \nas it should . All remaining English - and Spanish -speaking sampled KP panelists were included in \nthe full launch and were sent an invitation on May 10. \nAll panelists with an email address received an email invitation and up to three email reminders if \nthey did not respond to the survey. All ATP and KP panelists who consented to SMS messages \nreceived an SMS invitation and up to three SMS reminders.  \nInvitation and reminder dates, ATP Wave 147 \u2013 ATP sample  \n Soft launch  1 Soft launch 2  Full launch  \nInitial invitation  April 29, 2024  May 2, 2024  May 3, 2024  \nFirst reminder  May 6, 2024  May 6, 2024  May 6, 2024  \nSecond  reminder  May 9, 2024  May 9, 2024  May 9, 2024  \nFinal reminder  May 11, 2024  May 11, 2024  May 11, 2024  \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER   \n \nInvitation and reminder dates, ATP Wave 147 \u2013 KP sample  \n Soft launch  1 Soft launch 2  Full launch  \nInitial invitation  April 29, 2024  May 9, 2024  May 10, 2024  \nFirst reminder  May 12, 2024  May 12, 2024  May 12, 2024  \nSecond  reminder  May 15, 2024  May 15, 2024  May 15, 2024  \nFinal reminder  May 18, 2024  May 18, 2024  May 18, 2024  \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER   \n \nData quality checks  \nTo ensure high -quality data, the Center 's researchers performed data quality checks to identify any \nrespondents showing clear patterns of satisficing. This includes checking for whether respondents \nleft questions blank at very high rates or always selected the first or last answer presented. As a 47 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org result of this checking, three  respondent s were removed from the survey dataset prior to weighting \nand analysis.  \nWeighting  \nThis survey was  weighted in a multistep process that accounts for multiple stages of sampling and \nnonresponse that occur at different points in the survey process. First, each panelist begins with a \nbase weight that reflects their probability of selection for their initi al recruitment survey. These \nweights are then rescaled and adjusted to account for changes in the design of ATP recruitment \nsurveys from year to year. Base weights for KP respondents were provided by Ipsos.  \nBecause there are no benchmarks for the population of U.S. adults without children, weighting \nparameters were based on the full set of ATP members who were potentially eligible for inclusion \nin the sample prior to any screening. First, the base weights for  all ATP members who responded \nto the 2023 Annual Profile Survey (ATP Wave 133) were calibrated to align with the population \nbenchmarks in the accompanying table to create a full-panel weight . \nAmerican Trends Panel weighting dimensions for full -\npanel weight  \nVariable  Benchmark source  \nAge (detailed)  \nAge x Gender  \nEducation x Gender  \nEducation x Age  \nRace/Ethnicity x Education  \nBlack (alone or in combination) x Hispanic  \nBorn inside vs. outside the U.S. among \nHispanics and Asian Americans  \nYears lived in the U.S.  \nCensus region x Metropolitan status  2022 American Community Survey \n(ACS)  \nVolunteerism  2021  CPS Volunteering & Civic Life \nSupplement  \nParty affiliation x Voter registration  2022  CPS Voting and Registration \nSupplement  \nParty affiliation x Race/Ethnicity  \nFrequency of internet use  \nReligious affiliation  2023 National Public Opinion \nReference Survey  (NPORS)  \nNote: Estimates from the ACS are based on noninstitutionalized adults.

Weighting was performed separately using \nseparate targets for respondents ages 18 to 49 and those ages 50  and older.  \nRespondents ages 18  to 49 \nFor ages 18 to 49, weighting parameters were calculated based on all ATP members who said in \nWave 133 that they did not have any children and were not too likely or not at all likely to have \nchildren in the future. These parameters include age, gender, edu cation, race/ethnicity, place of \nbirth, years lived in the U.S., identification as Black (alone or in combination), census region, \nmetropolitan status, frequency of internet use, religion, party affiliation, voter registration and \nvolunteerism.  \nFor respondents in this group who completed the screening questions, including those who \nscreened ineligible, the full -panel weight was then calibrated to align with the parameters listed \nabove and trimmed at the 2nd and 9 8th percentiles  to reduce the loss in precision stemming from \nvariance in the weights. This trimming is performed separately among non -Hispanic Black, non -\nHispanic Asian, Hispanic and all other respondents.  \nRespondents ages 50 and older  \nFor ages 50 and older, weighting parameters were calculated based on all ATP members who said \nin Wave 133 that they did not have any children. These parameters include race/ethnicity by \ngender, age by gender, education by gender, age by education, race/eth nicity by education, born \ninside vs. outside the U.S. among Hispanics and Asian Americans, years lived in the U.S., \nidentification as Black (alone or in combination) by Hispanic ethnicity, census region by \nmetropolitan status, frequency of internet use, re ligion, party affiliation by race/ethnicity, and \nparty affiliation by voter registration.  \nBecause this group includes both ATP and KP respondents, base weights for respondents from \neach sample were rescaled and combined to account for the inclusion of multiple samples and \ntheir designs. The combined base weight was then calibrated to align with  the parameters listed \nabove and trimmed at the 2nd and 9 8th percentiles  to reduce the loss in precision stemming from \nvariance in the weights. This trimming is performed separately within cells defined by the cross \nclassification of gender by education.  \nAfter the weighting was performed for screener respondents from both age groups, individuals \nwho screened ineligible were removed from the data, with no further weighting adjustments. 49 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org Sampling errors and tests of statistical significance take into account the effect of weighting.  \nThe following table shows the unweighted sample sizes and the error attributable to sampling that \nwould be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey .  \nSample sizes and margins of error, ATP Wave 147 \nGroup  Unweighted  \nsample size  Plus or minus \u2026  \nAges 50+  2,542  2.4 percentage points  \nAges 18 -49 770 5.3 percentage points  \nNote: This survey includes oversamples of respondents  ages 50 and older .

143METHODLOGY Copyright \u00a9 2023 CompTIA | CompTIA.org | Cyberstates.org | State of the Tech Workforce | Page 144METHODOLOGY  METHODOLOGYCLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS AND CHANGES OVER TIMECompTIA's State of the Tech Workforce (Cyberstates) utilizes the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) to define the tech industry. The NAICS is a hierarchical system, with six-digit numbers assigned to the most specific industries. The NAICS is constructed around the concept of production and is able to reflect advances in technology, including many new service-oriented businesses. NAICS codes are revised periodically to reflect the emergence of new industry sectors or sub-sectors. Additionally, CompTIA revises its definition of technology industry periodically to best meet the needs of our audiences. Additionally, government labor market sources do occasionally enact backward revisions to the data, which may affect year-over-year comparisons, especially with percent changes. The wage data is presented as current dollars, meaning the figures are for the given year and not adjusted for inflation.NET TECH EMPLOYMENTThe tech workforce consists of two primary components. Net tech employment is a single metric that encompasses both components, making it easier to describe the tech workforce. The foundation is the set of technology occupation professionals working in technical positions, such as IT support, network engineering, software development and related roles. Many of these professionals work for technology companies (42%), but many others are employed by organizations across every industry sector or government entity in the U.S. economy (58%).The second component of the discussion consists of the business professionals employed by technology companies. These professionals play an important role in supporting the development and delivery of the technology products and services used throughout the economy. Thirty-nine percent of the net tech employment total consists of tech industry business professionals. See page 5 of this report for more details on the concept of Net Tech Employment.TECH INDUSTRY DEFINITIONThere are a number of considerations when developing a definition of the technology industry. In some cases, NAICS codes do not perfectly reflect industry dynamics. This can be especially challenging in times of rapid innovation, when new tech sectors emerge in a short period of time. More recently, the degree to which technology has become core to so many industry sectors poses new questions. For example, a technology platform designed to facilitate the online sale of goods may have traditionally been viewed as a retailer, although given the intense use of technology, an argument could be made to classify it as a technology firm.Conceptually, this report focuses on the sectors involved in making, creating, enabling, integrating, or supporting technology, whether as a product or service. At this time, the report does not include industry sectors categorized primarily as users of technology. TECH OCCUPATION DEFINITIONFor occupation-level analysis, this report utilizes the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System, which is a standard used by federal agencies to classify workers into occupational categories. See following page.WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS AND DIVERSITY INDEXThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks labor market composition across several demographic and firmographic characteristics. By race and ethnicity, the BLS segments data by seven top-level categorizations. Described here: https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/2019/home.htm. To measure overall race and ethnicity characteristics within the tech workforce, this report uses a metric called Simpson's Diversity Index. This index weights two key facets of  race and ethnicity within the workforce \u2013 richness and evenness (or think of it as depth and breadth) and reflects it in a single metric. See page 9 of this report for more details.CompTIA is responsible for all content contained in this report.

NAICS and SOCs are updated on regular cycles, but because of the pace of change in technology, government taxonomies do tend to lag the market. Additionally, the blurring of lines in technology means there are more gray areas in classification systems. See government sites for more details on NAICS and SOCs.

of the Tech Workforce (Cyberstates) utilizes the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) to define the tech industry. The NAICS is a hierarchical system, with six-digit numbers assigned to the most specific industries. The NAICS is constructed around the concept of production and is able to reflect advances in technology, including many new service-oriented businesses. NAICS codes are revised periodically to reflect the emergence of new industry sectors or sub-sectors. Additionally, CompTIA revises its definition of technology industry periodically to best meet the needs of our audiences. Additionally, government labor market sources do occasionally enact backward revisions to the data, which may affect year-over-year comparisons, especially with percent changes. The wage data is presented as current dollars, meaning the figures are for the given year and not adjusted for inflation.NET TECH EMPLOYMENTThe tech workforce consists of two primary components. Net tech employment is a single metric that encompasses both components, making it easier to describe the tech workforce. The foundation is the set of technology occupation professionals working in technical positions, such as IT support, network engineering, software development and related roles. Many of these professionals work for technology companies (42%), but many others are employed by organizations across every industry sector or government entity in the U.S. economy (58%).The second component of the discussion consists of the business professionals employed by technology companies. These professionals play an important role in supporting the development and delivery of the technology products and services used throughout the economy. Thirty-nine percent of the net tech employment total consists of tech industry business professionals. See page 5 of this report for more details on the concept of Net Tech Employment.TECH INDUSTRY DEFINITIONThere are a number of considerations when developing a definition of the technology industry. In some cases, NAICS codes do not perfectly reflect industry dynamics. This can be especially challenging in times of rapid innovation, when new tech sectors emerge in a short period of time. More recently, the degree to which technology has become core to so many industry sectors poses new questions. For example, a technology platform designed to facilitate the online sale of goods may have traditionally been viewed as a retailer, although given the intense use of technology, an argument could be made to classify it as a technology firm.Conceptually, this report focuses on the sectors involved in making, creating, enabling, integrating, or supporting technology, whether as a product or service. At this time, the report does not include industry sectors categorized primarily as users of technology. TECH OCCUPATION DEFINITIONFor occupation-level analysis, this report utilizes the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System, which is a standard used by federal agencies to classify workers into occupational categories. See following page.WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS AND DIVERSITY INDEXThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks labor market composition across several demographic and firmographic characteristics. By race and ethnicity, the BLS segments data by seven top-level categorizations. Described here: https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/2019/home.htm. To measure overall race and ethnicity characteristics within the tech workforce, this report uses a metric called Simpson's Diversity Index. This index weights two key facets of  race and ethnicity within the workforce \u2013 richness and evenness (or think of it as depth and breadth) and reflects it in a single metric. See page 9 of this report for more details.CompTIA is responsible for all content contained in this report.

NAICS and SOCs are updated on regular cycles, but because of the pace of change in technology, government taxonomies do tend to lag the market. Additionally, the blurring of lines in technology means there are more gray areas in classification systems. See government sites for more details on NAICS and SOCs.

State of the Tech Workforce quantifies the size and scope of the tech industry and the tech workforce across multiple vectors. To provide additional context, the report includes time-series trending, average wages, business establishments, job postings, gender ratios, innovation and emerging tech metrics, and more. For the interactive online version, please visit www.cyberstates.org. As with any sector-level report, there are varying interpretations of what constitutes the tech sector and the tech workforce. Some of this variance may be attributed to the objectives of the author. Is the goal to depict the broadest possible representation of STEM and digital economy fields, or a more narrowly defined technology subset? Is the goal to capture all possible knowledge workers, or a more narrowly defined technology subset? CompTIA weighs a number of factors in making these decisions. See the methodology section for details of the specific NAICS codes and SOC codes CompTIA uses in its definitions.IMPORTANT NOTE about timing: the 2022 estimates and 2023 projections represent the most up-to-date data at the time of reporting. As with any labor market data source there is a lag effect and recent developments during late 2022 and early 2023 will likely not be fully reflected in the data.CompTIA's base of IT certification holders spans 232 countries Copyright \u00a9 2023 CompTIA | CompTIA.org | Cyberstates.org | State of the Tech Workforce | Page 4TABLE OF CONTENTSBACKGROUND AND KEY FINDINGS   5NATIONAL SNAPSHOT   14STATE SNAPSHOTS   16METRO AREA SNAPSHOTS   68APPENDIX TABLES - A   120 NET TECH EMPLOYMENT TRENDING BY STATE    NET TECH EMPLOYMENT TRENDING BY METRO    RANKINGS: NET TECH EMPLOYMENT BY STATE     RANKINGS: NET TECH EMPLOYMENT BY METRO      APPENDIX TABLES - B   127  TECH WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS BY RACE AND ETHNICITY BY STATE TECH WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS BY RACE AND ETHNICITY BY METRO TECH WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS BY GENDER BY STATE TECH WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS BY GENDER BY METRO   TECH WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS BY OCCUPATION BY AGE  TECH WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS BY INDUSTRYAPPENDIX TABLES - C   135  TECH EMPLOYMENT 10-YEAR OUTLOOK BY OCCUPATION: 2023-2033    APPENDIX TABLES - D   137  TECH WAGE PERCENTILES BY STATE TECH WAGE PERCENTILES BY METROAPPENDIX TABLES - E   140  TECH INDUSTRY SECTOR DETAIL BY STATE TECH INDUSTRY SECTOR DETAIL BY METROMETHODOLOGY   143 BACKGROUND TECH INDUSTRY AND OCCUPATIONS CLASSIFICATIONS Copyright \u00a9 2023 CompTIA | CompTIA.org | Cyberstates.org | State of the Tech Workforce | Page 5DEFINING NET TECH EMPLOYMENTThe tech workforce consists of two primary components, represented as a single figure by the 'net tech employment' designation. The foundation is the set of technology professionals working in technical positions, such as IT support, network engineering, software development, data science, and related roles. Many of these professionals work for technology companies (42%), but many others are employed by organizations across every industry sector in the U.S. economy (58%).The second component consists of the business professionals employed by technology companies. These professionals \u2013 encompassing  sales, marketing, finance, HR, operations and management, play an important role in supporting the development and delivery of the technology products and services used throughout the economy. Approximately 39% of the net tech-employment total consists of tech industry business professionals. One final segment involves workers classified as self-employed. For the purposes of this report, only dedicated, full-time self-employed technology workers are counted towards net tech employment. Workers that are characterized as \"gig\" workers, which may entail working on the side for supplementary income, are excluded from this analysis due to several uncertainties with the data and to minimize the possibility of double counting.N = Technology professionals employed across the economy, including in the tech sector (e.g. software developers, network architects, database admins, etc.)  N = Tech sector employment, less technology professionals(e.g. sales, marketing, finance, HR, etc.)\n= 100,000 workers9.4 millionProjected total workers in 202361%% of NET tech employment is in technology occupations\nSource: Lightcast | U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | CompTIA Copyright \u00a9 2023 CompTIA | CompTIA.org | Cyberstates.org | State of the Tech Workforce | Page 65.06.58.09.5\n201720182019202020212022est.2023proj.+272,323+3.0%\n0.02.04.06.0\n201720182019202020212022est.2023proj.YEAR IN REVIEWNET TECH EMPLOYMENT TRENDING\nTECH INDUSTRY EMPLOYMENT TRENDINGKEY POINTS\u21e5The 2022 estimates and 2023 projections are presented with the most up-to-date data at the time of reporting. As with any labor market data source there is a lag effect and recent developments during late 2022 and early 2023 will likely not be fully reflected in the data. \u21e5Net tech employment in the United States \u2013 as described on the previous page, reached an estimated 9,156,390 workers in 2022, an increase of 3.2% year-over-year or approximately 286,400 additional workers employed in technology. \u21e5Employment in the tech sector has grown since the pandemic and could reach its projected target of 9,428,713, in 2023 which translates to 272,323 net new workers added or +3.0% growth. \u21e5The tech sector and the broader base of technology workers employed across the economy experienced several bumps during the pandemic, but generally held up well. In some cases, demand for technology services and infrastructure to support new remote work models, ecommerce, or revamped supply chains exploded, stretching the capacity of solution providers and MSPs.\u21e5Among the components of net tech employment, the tech sector side of the equation is projected to grow 3.2% in the year ahead, with the occupation side across the economy is projected to grow at 3.4%. \u21e5Within the technology industry category, which encompasses technology occupations and supporting business occupations, growth has varied. Since 2017, the IT services and custom software services category powered job growth, accounting for 52% of job gains. Software [product] accounted for 29% of the job gains in the same time period. Tech manufacturing saw a fall in number of jobs created in 2020 and 2021 but is forecasted to grow at 1.2% in 2023. \u21e5Within the tech occupation category, software, programmers, web and QA related occupations accounted for 59.5% of new jobs created between 2017 and 2022. \u21e5Top projected growth occupations for 2023:5.5% Data Scientists and Data Analysts5.2% Cybersecurity Analysts and Engineers4.7% Web Designers and UI/UX4.7% Software Developers and Engineers4.1% Software QA and Testers3.4% CIOs and IT Directors2.6% Systems Analysts and Engineers2.4% IT Support Specialists\u21e5Economic impact data further corroborates the importance of the tech sector. As a percentage of the overall U.S. economy, the tech industry accounts for 8.8% of direct economic value, which translates to over $1.97 trillion.Tech ManufacturingTelecommunications and Internet ServicesSoftware [product/SaaS]\nIT Services and Custom Software ServicesMILLIONS OF WORKERSMILLIONS OF WORKERSTECH OCCUPATION EMPLOYMENT TRENDINGMILLIONS OF WORKERS0.02.04.06.0\n201720182019202020212022est.2023proj.Sy stems, Cybersecurit y and Da taCIOs , IT Directors, Emerging Tech and  O therIT Support, Network Admin and ArchitectureSoftw are, Pr og rammer s, Web and QA\nSource: Lightcast | U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | CompTIA+286,424+3.2% Copyright \u00a9 2023 CompTIA | CompTIA.org | Cyberstates.org | State of the Tech Workforce | Page 7Additional hires to offset retirements and workforce separations\n0400,000800,0001,200,00020122013201420152016201720182019202020212022THE DECADE AHEADKEY POINTS\u21e5According to projections from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Lightcast, in the next ten years the tech workforce will grow twice as fast as the overall U.S. workforce. The macro trend of digital transformation means demand for tech talent across the full spectrum of tech job roles will continue unabated.   \u21e5Calculating future workforce needs over the next decade is a function of several variables. There is a growth component, which may entail organizations adding headcount due to expansion or possibly to support new emerging technologies. There is a retirement factor, with a portion of the workforce transitioning away from the labor market permanently. And lastly, there is a segment leaving the workforce for some other reason, also referred to as separations. These may stem from a career change, layoffs, a return to school, family pursuits, or other. Changes to any of these variables will affect future workforce projections.\u21e5The replacement rate for tech occupations during the 2023-2033 period is expected to average about 7% annually, or approximately 400,000 workers each year, totaling several million through 2033. The total turnover rate, which encompasses workers transitioning within tech such as those promoted into a new role, is estimated to average 36% annually during the period. In comparison, the highest turnover occupations have annual rates typically in the 100%-200% range.\u21e5Tech occupation employment over the next 10 years is expected to grow at about twice the rate of overall employment across the economy. Projected tech growth rates above the national rate:\n\u21e5Job posting data provides another layer of insight into the tech job market outlook. Because government labor taxonomies \u2013 Standard Occupation Codes (SOCs), lag the speed with which the market changes, job posting data provides a more up-to-date look at the skills and experiences employers seek.\u21e5Overall tech job postings among U.S. employers dipped during 2020 due to the pandemic hiring slowdown and then rebounded through 2022 and into 2023. Note: job postings should not be interpreted as unfilled jobs and there is not a 1:1 relationship between postings and actual hires made.TECH OCCUPATION EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOKWorkforce need = annual replacement rate + growth rate\nEMERGING TECH DEMAND RAMPS UP+186% Growth in emerging tech job postingsAnnual emerging tech job postings by U.S. employersMILLIONS OF WORKERSAGGREGATE ANNUAL POSTINGS FOR TECH JOB ROLES\n01,000,0002,000,0003,000,0004,000,00020122013201420152016201720182019202020212022Job postings by U.S. employers4.35.86.8201320232033\n266%Data Scientists and Data Analysts242%Cybersecurity Analysts and Engineers180%Software Developers and Engineers164%Web Designers and UI/UX159%Web Developers132%Software QA and Testers99%CIOs and IT Directors49%Database Architects39%Systems Analysts and Engineers22%Network Support Specialists21%IT Support SpecialistsHiring activity to offset turnover\nSource: Lightcast | U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | CompTIA Copyright \u00a9 2023 CompTIA | CompTIA.org | Cyberstates.org | State of the Tech Workforce | Page 8$0K$25K$50K$75K$100K$125K$150K$175K$200K$225K$0K$25K$50K$75K$100K$125K$150K$175K\n10th p er-centile25th p er-centile50th(median)75th p er-centile90th p er-centileNational W age Perc entilesTech Wa ge PercentilesTHE MANY FACETS OF WAGE DATAANNUAL WAGE COMPARISON ACROSS OCCUPATIONSKEY POINTS\u21e5There are many nuances to the tech wage discussion. At the industry level \u2013 meaning the universe of technology companies in the sector, wages encompass all staff positions, from the CEO down to entry-level helpdesk workers. Both technical and non-technical positions factor into the industry wage calculation. Because of the diversity of positions covered, interpreting summary industry wage data requires accounting for these factors. In comparison, tech occupation wages cover only technical positions. This is the primary focus of the wage data of this report.\u21e5Cost of living differences mean the wages in one location are not directly comparable to another. For example, the buying power of a salary in San Francisco will not go nearly as far as in Des Moines. According to the National Association of Realtors, the median price for a home in Silicon Valley exceeds $1.2 million. See CompTIA IT Salary Calculator for detailed wage data across 400+ metro areas.\u21e5Beyond location, the other important variables to consider when reviewing wage data are job role, areas of expertise, job experience, industry sector, and company size. A skilled employee in a hot field such as artificial intelligence, working for a Fortune 500 company, will earn on average far more than a tech worker in an established field, working for a small business in a rural area. \u21e5Percentiles help provide insight into wage ranges. This approach minimizes the impact of outlier data points, such as workers receiving massive stock payouts. It is also useful in depicting wages along common career paths, with workers just starting out earning wages at the 10th percentile, and then with experience and additional training and certification, moving up through the higher wage levels.\u21e5Across all tech occupation categories covered in this report, the median wage, also referred to as the 50th percentile or midpoint, was an estimated $104,406 in 2022, the most recent year of available government data. This figure is more than double the median wage across all occupations of the U.S. labor force. Note: sources such as Glassdoor may provide more real-time data but the tradeoff is a higher degree of data uncertainty than data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\u21e5The scatterplot graph to the right illustrates the degree to which wages will differ across states. The data presents wages for software developers and IT support specialists across percentiles. Tenth and 25th percentiles often correspond to early-stage career positions (e.g. 0-4 years of experience), while 75th and 90th percentiles cover higher-end experience and expertise.\u21e5When drilling down to the metro area level, wage differences may become even more pronounced. Top tier wages in locations such as San Jose or New York City may run into hundreds of thousands, if not more when factoring in bonuses or stock options.TECH WAGES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BASED ON OCCUPATION, LOCATION, AND PERCENTILE\n75th percentile90th percentile10th percentile25th percentile130% higher\nWage percentile examples for Software Developers and IT Support Specialists \nWages in the same tech job can vary widely\nSource: Lightcast | U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | CompTIA Copyright \u00a9 2023 CompTIA | CompTIA.org | Cyberstates.org | State of the Tech Workforce | Page 9LABOR FORCE CHARACTERISTICS OVERVIEW\u21e5The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks labor market composition across several demographic and firmographic characteristics. By race and ethnicity, the BLS segments data by seven top-level categorizations. Described in detail here:\u21e5Additional population segmentations are available from the Census Bureau, but for the purposes of analyzing labor market compositions of specific occupation categories, the seven categories above are the extent of data availability.  DIVERSITY INDEX\u21e5There are several approaches to assessing labor force characteristics. Numeric totals and relative percentages are good starting points. Taking it a step further, however, provides deeper insights and more context.\u21e5To measure overall race and ethnicity characteristics within the tech workforce, this report uses a metric called Simpson's Diversity Index. This index weights two key facets of  race and ethnicity within the workforce \u2013 richness and evenness (or think of it as depth and breadth) and reflects it in a single metric.\u21e5The U.S. tech workforce recorded a Diversity Index measure of 59, roughly on par with the overall U.S. workforce measure of 57 on a 100-point scale. The District of Columbia recorded the highest tech workforce Diversity Index score at 68, followed by Texas, California, and Georgia. In contrast, the states at the other end of the continuum had tech workforce Diversity Index scores below 20.TECH WORKFORCE REPRESENTATION\u21e5As the name implies, tech workforce representation measures the composition of the tech workforce relative to the overall composition across all occupations.\u21e5Nationally, Black or African American workers represent 12% of the U.S. workforce and 8% of tech occupations. This gap signals underrepresentation in the tech workforce. Examples of states with high levels of tech workforce representation numerically and in relation to the overall workforce composition include the District of Columbia, Mississippi, Georgia, and Maryland.\u21e5Nationally, Hispanic or Latino workers represent 17% of the U.S. workforce and 8% of tech occupations. This gap signals underrepresentation in the tech workforce. Examples of states with high levels of tech workforce representation numerically and in relation to the overall workforce composition include New Mexico, Florida, Texas, and Arizona.\u21e5Nationally, women represent approximately 49% of the U.S. workforce and 26% of tech occupations. This gap signals underrepresentation in the tech workforce. Examples of states with high levels of tech workforce representation in relation to the overall workforce composition include the District of Columbia, Mississippi, Maine, and South Carolina.KEY FINDINGS \u2013 TECH WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS 8%\nvs. representation across all U.S. occupations  Black or African American8%Hispanic or Latino26%Women12%17%49%TECH WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICSU.S. tech occupation representation \nEXAMPLES OF TECH JOB REPRESENTATIONVS.

Net tech employment is projected to grow at an estimated 3.0% year-over-year reaching 9.4 million in 2023. \u21e5Net tech employment accounted for approximately 5.8% of the overall U.S. workforce in 2022. As noted previously, because of the blurring of lines across industries, there is a degree of undercounting in tech sector employment.U.S. TECH INDUSTRY EMPLOYMENT\u21e5U.S. tech industry employment totaled an estimated 6.1 million in 2022, an increase of 199,147 workers from 5.9 million in 2021. Tech industry employment is projected to grow at an estimated 3.2% year-over-year reaching 6.3 million in 2023. As noted, tech industry employment is a subset of net tech employment.\u21e5Tech manufacturing employment totaled an estimated 1.1 million in 2022 and is projected to grow by 13,345 jobs in 2023. \u21e5Among the seven major tech manufacturing subsectors \u2013 the OEMs and companies producing computing hardware, peripherals, semiconductors, etc., one is projected to experience employment losses, while the remaining categories are projected to experience job gains. \u21e5Employment in the telecommunications and Internet services sector totaled an estimated 1.5 million in 2022, projected to go up by 39,553 jobs in 2023. These employment gains are driven by growth in the data processing, hosting, and search portal services categories, where employment should increase by 45,277 jobs. Wired and wireless telecommunications services are projected to lose 8,669 jobs for the same time period.\u21e5The software category, consisting of general purpose software that is not custom developed, also known as published or packaged software products (including SaaS),  employed an estimated 596,343 workers in 2022, and is projected to add more than 28,000 net new jobs. On a percent change basis, software will lead the tech sector with a 4.7% projected year-over-year growth rate.\u21e5The IT services and custom software services subsector will generate the largest numerical gain in employment, adding nearly 114,300 net-new jobs in 2023. This gain of 3.9% will increase the employment base to 3.04 million. This growth reflects the ongoing digital transformations occurring across the economy and the corresponding need for expertise in areas such as cloud computing migration, application integration, process automation, data analytics, and cybersecurity.U.S. TECH OCCUPATION EMPLOYMENT\u21e5Tech occupation jobs reached an estimated 5.6 million workers in 2022 and is projected to increase by 187,542 jobs in 2023. On a percent change basis, the annual growth rate is 3.4%. \u21e5Since 2017, more than 680,000 new tech occupation jobs were added, a function of the demand for tech talent across every industry sector in the economy.\u21e5On a numeric basis, software developers, systems analysts and cybersecurity analysts, network architects, and IT support specialists recorded the largest gains in employment. While the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not yet break out many emerging tech roles, other data sources indicate these new specialties are starting to make meaningful contributions to the growth of the tech workforce.

All states are projected to generate positive tech employment job growth in 2022. While the largest job gains are associated with the states with a significant tech presence, the fact that most states experienced tech employment job gains speaks to the continued broad-based impact of technology across the nation. \u21e5On an industry sector basis, the IT services/custom software services sector has been the growth engine for the greatest number of states over the past year. Year-over-year distribution of counts of top categories by state:\u21e5IT services/custom software services: 49 states\u21e5Software: 48 states\u21e5Telecommunications: 43 states\u21e5Tech manufacturing: 37 states\u21e5The metrics used to provide context and insight into the data tend to be based on absolute size or are relative, which may involve percent change or account for factors such as population or economic size differences. Absolute measures tend to be highly correlated with the size of the state or metro area. For example, California is the largest state in the nation by a wide margin. Its population is 40% larger and its economy is 54% larger than second place Texas. California's economy is equal to the combined total of the bottom 25 states. Unsurprisingly, California is the leader in many State of the Tech Workforce categories.\u21e5California's net tech employment was an estimated 1,487,864 workers in 2022, a gain of 38,186 net new jobs year-over-year. Other states that experienced notable tech employment gains include Texas, New York, Florida, and Virginia. \u21e5On a percent change basis, the top five states for job growth in 2022 were Nevada (+6.4%), Tennessee (+6.2%), Texas (+5.5%), Washington (+5.5%), and Wyoming (+5.0%).\u21e5Employment concentration is a relative metric that compares tech employment to the overall base of employment within a state. Sixteen states are at a higher rate than the national average of 5.8%.\u21e5Washington has the highest concentration (9.4%) of tech workers relative to its overall employment base, which means citizens of the state are more likely to hold a tech job relative to other industry sectors.

These could be startups launching a new tech venture or established tech firms expanding operations with another business unit (e.g. opening a new business establishment in another state). Nationally, the count of tech business establishments increased 7.5% in 2022, or the equivalent of 40,507 additional business establishments.  \u21e5On a numeric basis, Florida had the largest year-over-year increase of net-new tech business establishments (+2,733). Rounding out the top five for net-new tech business establishments were Texas, North Carolina, Illinois, and Colorado. On a percent change basis, Wyoming experienced the largest increase at 15.7%, followed by South Dakota, North Dakota, Vermont, and Tennessee. STATE TECH ECONOMIC IMPACT\u21e5Economic impact is an assessment of output \u2013 the dollar value of goods and services produced during a given year (also referred to as gross domestic or regional product). As a percentage of the overall U.S. economy, the tech industry accounts for 8.8% of direct economic value, which translates to over $1.97 trillion.\u21e5A total of 29 states have a tech sector that generates $10 billion or more in direct economic impact to the state. California tops the list at a massive $535.9 billion in economic impact, representing 16.7% of the state's economy. On a dollar basis the other top states include Texas, New York, Washington, and Massachusetts. \u21e5In addition to the direct economic impact, there are downstream, indirect benefits of the technology industry. One way to assess this impact is the use of job multiplier metrics, also referred to as input-output modeling. For example, the IT services and custom software development services category has an estimated jobs multiplier of 4.8. For every one job in this tech subsector, an estimated 4.8 additional jobs are created or supported through direct, indirect, or induced means.STATE EMPLOYER JOB POSTINGS\u21e5On volume basis the top states for employer hiring activity via tech job postings in 2022 were California, Texas, Florida, and New York. States that saw the greatest increase year-over-year were California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, and Virginia.\u21e5Top states for emerging tech job postings in 2022 were California (186,418), Texas (113,629), New York (60,684), Virginia (57,316), and Illinois (54,895). States that saw the largest increase in emerging tech positions in 2022 when compared to the previous year were California (+19,023), Texas (+12,665), and Illinois (+11,505). \u21e5Emerging tech job postings as a percentage of total tech job postings are highest in Washington (42.7% of IT Job postings are emerging tech), Massachusetts (39.5%), South Dakota (38.9%), Delaware (34.4%), and Tennessee (34.3%). THE WORK FROM HOME (WFH) IMPACT\u21e5The job posting data confirms a momentous shift in thinking about work location among employer and employees. Among all tech job postings in 2022, 34% specified a WFH or hybrid work option, or slightly over 1.4 million job postings. This represents a 146% increase over the 2019 pre-pandemic rate.

It follows that it also has the largest base of tech employment.\u21e5Silicon Valley continues to be a critically important hub for innovation. Between San Francisco and San Jose, there are a little more than 700,000 tech industry and tech occupation workers. The discussion doesn't end there, however, as technology increasingly has a significant presence across the nation. Cities such as Boston, Seattle, New York, Dallas, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Denver and more, boast sizable tech workforces and notable job gain rates. This includes the sometimes \"under the radar\" tech cities of Austin, Raleigh, Charlotte, Phoenix, Detroit, Orlando, and more. METRO AREA EMPLOYMENT CONCENTRATION\u21e5Employment concentration provides a measure of tech employment relative to employment across all the other industry sectors in a local economy. Along with economic impact as a percentage of a local economy, these metrics help to put tech into context. \u21e5At 31.3%, San Jose has the highest concentration of net tech employment as a percentage of its overall employment base. \u21e5Compared to the national tech employment concentration benchmark of 5.8%, 25 metro areas had the same rate or higher, confirming the importance of technology to a far-reaching set of cities across the country.  METRO AREA TECH BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS\u21e5A large, dynamic base of business establishments, also referred to as company locations, is another measure of a healthy tech sector. The New York City metro area is home to 23,149 tech business establishments. Other top cities are Washington DC, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Seattle. \u21e5The vast majority of tech business establishments are categorized as small businesses under the Small Business Administration's definition of up to 500 employees. \u21e5Outside of the top five, the next largest metropolitan areas for the number of tech sector business establishments include Denver, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, and Atlanta. METRO AREA EMPLOYER JOB POSTINGS\u21e5Cities with the most tech job postings in 2022 were New York, Washington DC, Dallas, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco. In terms of year over year numerical change, the top 5 metros were New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, and Houston. \u21e5Emerging tech job positions were highest in New York City (78,667), Washington DC (63,469), San Francisco (57,506), Dallas (52,945), and Los Angeles (46,927) round out the top five cities for emerging tech job postings.

of the Tech Workforce (Cyberstates) utilizes the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) to define the tech industry. The NAICS is a hierarchical system, with six-digit numbers assigned to the most specific industries. The NAICS is constructed around the concept of production and is able to reflect advances in technology, including many new service-oriented businesses. NAICS codes are revised periodically to reflect the emergence of new industry sectors or sub-sectors. Additionally, CompTIA revises its definition of technology industry periodically to best meet the needs of our audiences. Additionally, government labor market sources do occasionally enact backward revisions to the data, which may affect year-over-year comparisons, especially with percent changes. The wage data is presented as current dollars, meaning the figures are for the given year and not adjusted for inflation.NET TECH EMPLOYMENTThe tech workforce consists of two primary components. Net tech employment is a single metric that encompasses both components, making it easier to describe the tech workforce. The foundation is the set of technology occupation professionals working in technical positions, such as IT support, network engineering, software development and related roles. Many of these professionals work for technology companies (42%), but many others are employed by organizations across every industry sector or government entity in the U.S. economy (58%).The second component of the discussion consists of the business professionals employed by technology companies. These professionals play an important role in supporting the development and delivery of the technology products and services used throughout the economy. Thirty-nine percent of the net tech employment total consists of tech industry business professionals. See page 5 of this report for more details on the concept of Net Tech Employment.TECH INDUSTRY DEFINITIONThere are a number of considerations when developing a definition of the technology industry. In some cases, NAICS codes do not perfectly reflect industry dynamics. This can be especially challenging in times of rapid innovation, when new tech sectors emerge in a short period of time. More recently, the degree to which technology has become core to so many industry sectors poses new questions. For example, a technology platform designed to facilitate the online sale of goods may have traditionally been viewed as a retailer, although given the intense use of technology, an argument could be made to classify it as a technology firm.Conceptually, this report focuses on the sectors involved in making, creating, enabling, integrating, or supporting technology, whether as a product or service. At this time, the report does not include industry sectors categorized primarily as users of technology. TECH OCCUPATION DEFINITIONFor occupation-level analysis, this report utilizes the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System, which is a standard used by federal agencies to classify workers into occupational categories. See following page.WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS AND DIVERSITY INDEXThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks labor market composition across several demographic and firmographic characteristics. By race and ethnicity, the BLS segments data by seven top-level categorizations. Described here: https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/2019/home.htm. To measure overall race and ethnicity characteristics within the tech workforce, this report uses a metric called Simpson's Diversity Index. This index weights two key facets of  race and ethnicity within the workforce \u2013 richness and evenness (or think of it as depth and breadth) and reflects it in a single metric. See page 9 of this report for more details.CompTIA is responsible for all content contained in this report.

NAICS and SOCs are updated on regular cycles, but because of the pace of change in technology, government taxonomies do tend to lag the market. Additionally, the blurring of lines in technology means there are more gray areas in classification systems. See government sites for more details on NAICS and SOCs.
