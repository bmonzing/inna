From check-ins to practical money tips, this month was about making steady progress and caring for your financial and emotional well-being.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| CTA Button                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Grow your financial knowledge Link to Paven Benefit Article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Grow your financial knowledge Link to Paven Benefit Article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Profile Builder Promo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Your profile = your Paven Personalize your Paven experience by completing your profile!

They are holding a mobile phone.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Multiple accounts will likely be needed to fund retirement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt's important for employees to be able to save and pay for health care. And the more they save, the more prepared they are to make good health care decisions. Once employees have saved enough and then choose to invest a portion of their health savings account (HSA) funds, it can become one of the single best accounts for tax savings, helping them save for the long term and into retirement.\n\nOptum Financial wants to help make investing easy and more accessible for users by offering a health savings brokerage account (HSBA) through Charles Schwab, a leader in self-directed brokerage accounts. An HSBA through Schwab offers investors a broad range of investments including equities, bonds, exchange traded funds, mutual funds and more.\n\nAdding an HSBA to your health savings account gives you and your employees the advantages of working with a company driven to meet the needs of today's investors through constant innovation, choice with value and dedicated service and support.\n\n## Make the most of your Optum Financial HSA\n\nInvesting HSA dollars has many potential tax benefits and can be an additional way to save for long-term health care needs and financial goals. HSAs are triple tax-advantaged, making them an effective savings and investment account.\n\n-  Contributions to an HSA are income tax-free\n-  All interest earnings and investment growth from deposits are income tax-free*\n-  Withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are income tax-free\n\nBeing financially prepared can help your employees make better health care decisions, which in turn helps you have a healthier and more productive workforce.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Savvy investors\n\nEmployees can use an HSA with other retirement accounts to maximize their long-term savings. A tax-advantaged HSA allows employees to plan and save for future medical expenses in retirement, when costs can be significant. An HSBA within the HSA can satisfy more sophisticated investors who require a more personalized investment experience.\n\n## Here's how the HSBA works\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Easy electronic account open\n\nAn employee clicks on the Schwab HSBA option from their member portal, chooses 'Enroll' to be directed to the HSBA site and follows  the steps to open th e ir account at Schwab.\n\n## More choices, plus zero commissions and fees for online trades\n\nThrough HSBA, account holders can invest in listed ETFs and stocks commission-free across all mobile, automated phone, and web trading channels. Additionally, account holders have access to fixed income investments and thousands of mutual funds from hundreds of fund families. Many of which are no-load, no-transaction fee funds.\n\n## Access to research tools and advice\n\nEmployees can research, trade and monitor investments in their HSBAs with the support of independent third-party and proprietary research reports, advanced online screening tools and market commentary from industry experts. A convenient mobile app makes it easy to stay connected and informed on the go.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dedicated service and support\n\nWhen employees need assistance with their HSBA, there are experienced representatives available to assist through the HSBA contact center. These representatives average more than a decade of Schwab and industry experience and specialize in serving HSA account investors.\n\nFor more information about our investment solutions, contact ingenuity@optum.com\n\n*Investment gains may apply in some states. Federal income tax is waived on all contributions. Most states, with the exception of CA and NJ, exempt HSA contributions from income tax.\n\nInvestments are not FDIC insured, are not bank issued or guaranteed by Optum Financial or its subsidiaries, including Optum Bank, and are subject to risk including fluctuations in value and the possible loss of the principal amount invested.\n\nSelf-directed mutual fund investment options are made available through the services of an independent investment advisor, or your plan sponsor.

We could potentially combine levels 1-2\n\n- Self-Sufficiency - Work earnings cover basic needs and unexpected expenses without additional debt\n- Stability - 3-6 months emergency savings with manageable debt levels\n- Flexibility - Enough savings to take calculated risks like job changes without financial stress\n- Independence - Work by choice rather than necessity with enough passive income to cover living expenses\n- Abundance - More than enough wealth for generous giving and any desired lifestyle\n\n1.

It plays off the tech-savvy language Meta employees live and breathe.\n\nOS = operating system and reframes financial wellness as a system you can strengthen, streamline, and personalize. Not a full reboot. Not a reset. Just... optimized.  This is  coming off of June in which we have planned Summer Slowdown.\n\nIt communicates:\n\n- Agency: You're in control of how you run your financial life\n- Efficiency: Let's eliminate friction, automate smartly, and use the right tools\n- Growth: Small upgrades now can create major impact later\n- Support: Paven isn't the OS\u2014you are. We're the tech that supports your growth\n\n### \n\n### Financial Freedom, Ignited\nSpark your plan. Light up your goal\n\nThis theme gives a subtle nod to Independence Day without going full stars and stripes. \"Ignited\" brings in the energy of fireworks: movement, momentum, and a spark of something powerful.

This theme taps into that momentum, encouraging users to review their progress, reset their budgets, and plan for Open Enrollment and year-end goals.\n\n- Planning for OE (healthcare, FSA/HSA, dependents)\n- Saving for back-to-school or caregiving\n- Resetting goals before Q4\n- Credit cleanup before holidays\n- Insurance and estate planning refreshers\n- New routines, new money habits\n- Clarify or combine financial goals\n- Open Enrollment prep + dependents\n- Refresh on insurance, estate planning, or credit basics\n- Getting back to structure with confidence\n- Addressing financial stress before it builds\n\nOwn Your Path\n\nEmpower users to align financial choices with their values, timeline, and vision for success.\n\n##### August \u2013 \"Choose What Matters\"\n\n- Prioritize what aligns with your values\n- Use your pay raise or surplus to reflect your goals\n- Revisit 401(k) and HSA elections before OE\n- Planning for back-to-school or caregiving\n- Travel vs. long-term savings decisions\n\nThrive in Transition\n\nSupport users during seasonal and financial transitions with confidence and care.\n\n##### July \u2013 \"Summer Strong\"\n\n- Summer spending without setbacks\n- Managing extra income wisely\n- Career growth + investing in yourself\n- RSUs or bonuses: progress update\n- Short-term money wins to build momentum\n\nMomentum Matters \u2013 Finish Strong\n\nInspire users to build financial momentum by turning reflection into action.\n\n- Budget now for holidays and OE\n- Goal tracking and planning for Q4\n- How to reset after burnout or setbacks\n- Review your investing progress\n- Get personalized help with Lyra or Financial Finesse\n\n##### September \u2013 \"Build for the Life You Want\" or \"Make Space for What Matters\"\n\n- Use reviews & Open Enrollment to align benefits with future plans\n- Caregiving, dependents, legacy planning\n- Continue investing in yourself: career, growth, stability\n- Prep for holidays + Q4 without financial stress\n\n#### \ud83c\udf42 September Theme: \"Pump Up the Plan\"\n\n**Why it works:** September = back to routine.

Dual Point System Proposal (1).docx/Users/287096/open-webui/backend/data/uploads/ba279620-69ee-43cc-a749-ccd3f4173aca_Financial Wellness Score - Dual Point System Proposal (1).docx{"content": "The Case for a Dual-Score System: Synchronizing the Paven Score & Financial Wellness Score\n\nWe loved the idea of dual score systems and agree it should be in use on the back end to deliver the overall FWS (Financial Wellness Score) to Paven users. To maximize engagement and deliver real financial impact, Paven should introduce a dual-score system where the Financial Wellness Score (FWS) measures financial health and the Paven Score (PS) (Paven engagement, education, articles, polls, and proactive behaviors). These two scores work in synchrony\u2014enhancing each other to create a continuous financial growth loop rather than a one-time assessment.\n\n**1. Why Synchronizing Both Scores Matters**\n\nA single financial wellness score provides a snapshot of financial health but doesn't incentivize ongoing improvement. By integrating a Paven Score, we ensure users stay engaged in Meta-sponsored financial wellness initiatives and Paven's tools, even after achieving financial stability.\n\n- **Without a Paven Score:** Users with a high financial wellness score may disengage, seeing no reason to continue using Paven.\n- **With a Paven Score:** Financially secure users are still motivated to optimize, learn, and explore new opportunities.\n- **Synchronicity means the two scores influence each other:** Higher financial engagement improves and enhances financial health, and better financial health requires ongoing learning, involvement, and a growth mindset.\n\n**2. The Financial Wellness Score (FWS): Measuring Stability & Readiness**\n\nThe FWS evaluates financial well-being across key areas:\n\n| Category                                | What It Measures                                          |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Savings & Liquidity                     | Emergency fund, paycheck-to-paycheck risk                 |\n| Debt & Credit Management                | Debt-to-income ratio, credit health                       |\n| Wealth-Building & Investments           | 401(k), RSUs, ESPP, diversified investments               |\n| Spending & Financial Planning           | Budgeting, discretionary spending, future financial goals |\n| Utilization of Meta Benefits            | Use of company-sponsored financial wellness programs      |\n| Future Financial Readiness & Protection | Insurance, estate planning, tax optimization              |\n| Financial Mindset & Stress Management   | Work productivity impact, emotional response to money     |\n\n**Goal of the FWS:** Show where users stand financially and highlight what they need to improve.\n\n**3. The Paven Score (PS): Measuring Engagement & Proactive Behavior**\n\nThe Paven Score ensures financial wellness is an ongoing journey, not a one-time destination. It tracks:\n\n| Category                       | What It Measures                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Content Engagement             | Reading Paven articles, watching videos, completing learning modules                   |\n| Tool Usage                     | Using financial calculators, budget planners, savings trackers                         |\n| Benefit Exploration            | Engaging with Meta's financial perks (401(k) match, ESPP, HSAs, tuition reimbursement) |\n| Proactive Progress             | Taking recommended actions based on financial score insights                           |\n| Community & Expert Interaction | Attending webinars, financial coaching sessions, or peer challenges                    |\n\n**Goal of the PS** : Keep users motivated and engaged, even when their financial situation improves.\n\n**Why This Works:**\n\n\u2705 **Keeps Everyone Engaged** \u2013 Users who score well financially stay motivated by earning points for engagement rather than just their financial status.\n\u2705 **Simplifies the User Experience** \u2013 No need to track two separate scores\u2014just one that balances both financial health and participation/growth mindset/knowledge/action.\n\u2705 **Benefits Paven & Meta** \u2013 Users continue using the app, leading to higher retention and ongoing learning.\n\u2705 **Encourages a Growth Mindset** \u2013 No matter how financially stable someone is, they can always improve their knowledge, optimize their benefits, and earn a higher score.\n\n4. How the Scores Work Together (Synchronicity in Action)\n\n**Paven Score (PS) Drives Financial Wellness (FWS)**\n\n- Higher engagement with Paven's resources leads to better financial decision-making, improving the FWS.\n- **Example:** A user reads budgeting content \u2192 adjusts their budget plan \u2192 their financial wellness score increases.\n\n**Financial Wellness Score (FWS) Sustains Engagement (PS)**\n\n- Users with strong financial wellness still have room for optimization and learning.\n- **Example:** A user achieves financial stability \u2192 keeps engaging in investment content, tax strategies, and advanced wealth-building topics \u2192 maintains a high Paven Score.\n\n**Both Scores Provide Meta HR with Valuable Insights**\n\n- FWS helps HR track workforce financial health trends and where their employees are at.\n- PS shows engagement levels and whether employees are utilizing Meta's financial benefits effectively.\n\n**5. Business Impact: Why This Dual System Benefits Meta & Paven**\n\n- **For Users (Meta Employees):** Keeps financial wellness interactive, engaging, and habit-forming rather than just a one-time assessment.\n- **For Paven:** Ensures continuous app engagement, increasing retention, feature usage, and long-term value.\n- **For Meta HR & Executives:** Provides ROI on financial wellness initiatives by showing not just financial health trends/wellness of employees but also employee benefit utilization & engagement.\n\n**How to Calculate It?**\n\n| Category                 | Weight   | What It Measures?                                                           |\n|--------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Savings & Emergency Fund | 15%      | Has the user saved enough for unexpected expenses?                          |\n| Debt-to-Income Ratio     | 15%      | Is debt under control relative to income?                                   |\n| Retirement & Investments | 10%      | Is the user on track for long-term financial stability?                     |\n| Spending & Budgeting     | 10%      | Are they effectively managing daily expenses?                               |\n| Credit Health            | 10%      | Is their credit in a strong range?                                          |\n| Engagement with Paven    | 40%      | Reading articles, using tools, exploring benefits, attending webinars, etc. |\n\nScore Range & Messaging\n\n- \ud83d\udd34 **0-40 (Needs Attention)** \u2013 Financial risk present; start using Paven for improvement.\n- \ud83d\udfe1 **41-70 (Making Progress)** \u2013 Some financial risks exist, but good engagement shows improvement.\n- \ud83d\udfe2 **71-100 (Thriving & Growing)** \u2013 Solid financial health and continued engagement.\n\n**Example Scenarios**\n\n**User A (Financially Struggling, But Highly Engaged)**\n\n- Low savings, high debt\u2014but actively using Paven's tools and learning about financial wellness.\n- **Score:** 55 \u2013 \"You're on the right track!

We welcome the diversity of perspective this brings. We treat each other respectfully\u2014even when we have differing ideas\u2014by assuming positive intent and leading with curiosity.\n\n- **Work schedules that allow collaboration across time zones.** See [Working Hours Across Time Zones](.) chart above for everyone's typical availability, keeping in mind that our schedules may flex day-to-day. (Review the \"What are our working hours expectations?\" section in the [team activity Figjam](https:/www.figma.com/board/mCSkWEynyYLh5oJnmg2wer/Paven-Q2-team-activity?node-id=0-1&t=JOZaaNVOu1wX2iIv-1) for individual factors that may affect working hours.)\n\n- **Schedule meetings at appropriate times for each other's time zones.**\n    - Consult the [Working Hours Across Time Zones](.) chart and everyone's Outlook calendars for availability and schedule accordingly.\n    - All-team meetings should take place between **15:00 and 18:00 UTC** to ensure everyone's availability.\n    - Smaller group or 1:1 meetings can occur anytime within the overlapping times that all attendees are available. In other words, don't schedule something outside of someone's normal working hours.\n    - If the need is urgent and we cannot wait until an appropriate time is available for all, the meeting facilitator will record the meeting and/or provide an update to anyone not in attendance.\n\n- **Communicate our planned time off to the team via the Paven PTO calendar.** If you do not have access to that in Outlook, ask Leif Drake to add you. In addition to marking your time off on the Paven PTO calendar, it's also a best practice to:\n    - Mark your own calendar with an all-day invite set to \"Out of Office\" in Outlook. This will block your calendar to show purple for your availability. That way, when others try to schedule meetings with you, they'll know you're out of office.\n    - Send an all-day invite set to \"Free\" in Outlook to the full Paven team and any other partners you work with regularly. This will ensure everyone is aware of your time off without having to go to the Paven PTO calendar.\n    - Set an Automatic Reply in Outlook for the days you plan to be away. Include the timeframe of your absence and who to contact for urgent needs while you are out.\n\n- **Use Teams for everyday collaboration outside of meetings.** **Use email sparingly for daily needs.**\n    - Use the Paven Standup meeting chat on Teams for topics that apply to or require help from the entire team. Otherwise, message folks directly or in smaller groups.\n    - Remember that everyone works in different time zones and their responses may be delayed or sent in hours outside of your normal working hours.\n    - That in mind, we can generally expect a response from someone **within 1 hour** of sending a Teams message.\n    - If using email to communicate something more complex outside of Teams, our expected ETA for a response is within 1 day.\n\n- **Plan and track our work using a shared system, based on individual capacity over a 2-week sprint.** (Right now, we use Jira and Confluence. But soon that will change to Azure DevOps.)\n    - Unplanned work over a 2-week sprint can be brought in but may require prioritization over planned work. Discuss as a team and/or with your manager before taking on unplanned work about what to de-prioritize, if needed.\n    - Individual team members are responsible for creating and moving their own stories across the board for each sprint.\n    - We consult the sprint board every standup to stay aware of each other's workstreams and help each other with blockers as needed.\n\n- **Help each other remove blockers and collaborate to get sprint work done.** This requires timely and active communication! As a team, we agree to raise blockers, questions, support needs, offer help, provide answers, etc. to each other quickly and effectively via Teams, standup, or other meetings.\n\n- **Attend and actively participate in all required team meetings:**\n    - Standup\n    - Sprint review\n    - Sprint planning\n    - Ad-hoc project meetings as they arise\n    - Monthly retrospectives\n    - Quarterly planning\n\n## Meeting etiquette (general)\n\nTo create the best conditions for a productive and collaborative meeting, we agree to follow these meeting etiquette practices as much as possible.\n\nWhen scheduling meetings:\n\n- Find a time that works for each attendee's time zone ( [Working Hours Across Time Zones](.) **) and work around their existing meetings.**\n- Include a descriptive name for the meeting in the subject line.\n- Include a brief agenda and/or objective for the meeting.\n- Link or attach any necessary documents for context.\n- Take notes or arrange to have an attendee take notes during the meeting.\n- Record the call if needed.\n- Turn on your camera to share both visual and verbal communication with attendees.\n- Track the time and prompt people to move on to the next topic as needed.\n- End the meeting on time to allow participants to get to their next meeting or task.\n- Send meeting notes out to the attendees with necessary action items/next steps, if necessary. (Whenever a key decision is made or there are many action items, it's best to document them for reference.)\n\nWhen invited to meetings:\n\n- RSVP your attendance as soon as possible to let the organizer know if you can make it. Please do not wait until the day of the meeting to give the host ample time to reschedule or prepare alternatives for you.\n- If you can't make the meeting, do one of the following:\n    - Suggest a new time that works better for you using the Propose New Time feature on the Outlook invitation.\n    - Direct message the meeting organizer to discuss alternative times, sending a proxy in your place, or determine if you can get caught up afterwards via meeting notes or a recording.\n- Join meetings punctually. Message the host if you are running late with an ETA for your arrival.\n- Turn on your camera to share both visual and verbal communication with the host and/or other attendees.\n- Actively listen and participate during meetings.\n- Leave meetings running long if you have other obligations to attend to, making sure to follow up with the host to request meeting notes and any action items for yourself."}{"name": "Team_Working_Agreement_June2025.docx", "content_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "size": 115148, "data": {}, "collection_name": "10ca88a4-9abd-406c-8649-fa1d662007d4"}nullhí[º}µ¥é˛ …  Æ∏Å        UUÅ'ÅM]Ç1hí[öc0089875-dc29-4e26-b0ca-893bbf285597a54e815a-10d9-434a-bfda-d1aa9015facb01dbf30a3ad595d7c9c89bf597a4b7282d256b0c67d99355a84155225de08c2dLife-Logo.pdf/Users/287096/open-webui/backend/data/uploads/c0089875-dc29-4e26-b0ca-893bbf285597_Life-Logo.pdf{"content": "(life@)\n\n<!-- image -->"}{"name": "Life-Logo.pdf", "content_type": "application/pdf", "size": 73866, "data": {}, "collection_name": "10ca88a4-9abd-406c-8649-fa1d662007d4"}nullhí[öÑú›ÇÜ—  "≠Ï        UUÅgÇ™;Éahí\`c2da191d-acd0-4e67-b87e-3ad87f316553a54e815a-10d9-434a-bfda-d1aa9015facb5b140f838512a038f52276662ca4f4f6af32c00adb8754923f2727af4381e957NOVEMBER 2024 Newsletter Paven Pulse #15.docx/Users/287096/open-webui/backend/data/uploads/c2da191d-acd0-4e67-b87e-3ad87f316553_NOVEMBER 2024 Newsletter Paven Pulse #15.docx{"content": "**NOVEMBER 2024 Newsletter: Paven Pulse #15**\n\n**DATE: 11/19**\n\nItems we'll cover:\n\n- Current month theme:\n- Survey results\n- Events\n- Trending personal finance studies/topics:\n- Intro next month's theme: November\n\n- HSA Brokerage Account\n\n**Audience:** All Paven users (dormant, disengaged, active, engaged)\n\n**Themes:**\n\n**Subject line:**\n\n| Nameplate    | Paven Pulse Issue #15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Top headline | Ready to feast with family and friends?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Subhead      | The holidays can be hectic, especially with all of the travel plans and shopping lists to get through.

Can I use my second pair benefit on Meta smart glasses if I used the first pair benefit on regular glasses or contacts? | Yes. You can use your Meta smart glasses benefit in lieu of your first or second pair benefit once per calendar year. If you purchased regular glasses or contacts using your first pair benefit and have not used your second pair benefit, you can use your $300 allowance towards a pair of Meta smart glasses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| What does it mean 'there is not a separate frame and lens benefit for smart glasses'? How is this different from regular glasses?            | If a Metamate chooses smart glasses in lieu of first or second pair eyewear, the total allowance of $150 or $300 is applied towards the total cost of the glasses (frame + lenses). Regular prescription glasses (using your first or second pair eyewear benefit) offer separate lens and frame benefits, which means the $150 or $300 allowance is applied towards the frames only and the prescription lenses are covered in full less any copay(s). Additional lens enhancements may incur additional cost(s).

Very accurately - I know exactly where everything stands and feel confident Somewhat accurately - I'm generally aware but can second guess myself sometimes Not very accurately - I often feel like my finances are worse (or better) than they actually are Not at all - I avoid checking my accounts because I get anxious and don't trust my instincts                                          |\n| Design direction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Icons to align with each answer choice \ud83c\udfaf Bullseye (Very clearly)  \ud83c\udfa1 Spinning wheel (Somewhat clearly)  \ud83c\udfad Mask with shifting faces (Not very clearly)  \ud83c\udfaa Closed tent flap (Not at all)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Screen 3: Context Screen #1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| [Title \u2013  / 45]  What is money dysmorphia?  [Paragraph 1 \u2013 / 147]  Like a funhouse mirror, money dysmorphia is when your perception of your finances does not match reality. It distorts your view, like feeling behind when you're not, or confident while overspending or missing red flags.   [Paragraph 2 \u2013 / 147] It can look like doubting smart decisions or getting blindsided by low balances.

Life is change; keep yourself open to the possibilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThose goals might take some balancing and trade off. So you should plan for the best, but stay prepped and ready for all the rest. Make a plan by looking into your budget, getting consultations, and knowing what actions you can take now to prepare a strong future for yourself and your loved ones.\n\nGive back to yourself by giving yourself daily wins for long run success.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStick to strategies, and don't leave earnings on the table. Sharpen your strategy and keep more of your money with expert tax advice. You can make taxes a habit by booking help from an advisor at Deloitte. You can schedule right through Paven. You might even find a new tax breaker while you're there.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTap into communities with WorkPlace. You don't have to build financial resilience alone. The best way to get a boost is from others on the same journey as you. Finance focused groups on WorkPlace can give you new sources of guidance and inspiration on your journey.

This includes quantitative and qualitative research, experimentation, discovery work, technical projects, and more.\n\nOur Q2 content strategy supports our overall product goals for enhanced personalization, using two distinct but interconnected content types:\n\n- [Publications](.) \u2013 Articles and comms support personalization by providing us metrics that signify interest in specific topics by user, which we can then segment for targeted communications and/or publications.\n- [Product content](.) \u2013 Features such as the Wellness Score and Profile Builder provide behind-the-scenes data for us to more accurately and strategically segment our users based on their preferences and behaviors.\n\n#### Publications\n\n**Publications** include both articles and communication vehicles. The Paven content team manages a regular cadence of the following:\n\n- Articles \u2013 new, refreshed, or republished:\n    - Finwell article\n    - Benefits article\n    - Video\n    - Poll\n- Communication \u2013 to subscribed members:\n    - Email newsletter\n    - Benefit spotlight email\n    - Push notifications\n\nMore information about each publication type can be found in the [appendix](.) of this document. Also note that we have a Q2 project to create a strategy for **segmented communication** . (See the [Experiments section](.) for more info.)\n\n#### General schedule/cadence\n\nWe follow a general schedule (repeatable cadence) and consider specific themes and strategic inputs when planning what to publish each month.\n\n| What                           | When                           | Includes                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| New (or refreshed) publication | 1 per week Tuesdays            | Types: Article (benefit or finwell), Paven Poll, Video Pusht notification Home page feature (Poll only): Action card for \"Your next steps\" (Benefit spotlight only): Email |\n| Flex push                      | 1 per week Thursdays           | An existing article that is relevant based on time of year, business needs, trends, etc. Push notification                                                                 |\n| Benefit Spotlight              | 1 per month 1st week of month  | New or refreshed article highlighting a key benefit from Meta Push notification Email                                                                                      |\n| Paven Poll                     | 1 per month 2nd or 3rd week    | Poll questions to understand our users better Contextual content to educate and inform Push notification                                                                   |\n| Paven Pulse                    | 1 per month Last week of month | Monthly topic summary Poll recap/results with research invite What's new (new articles from the month) What's next (upcoming articles/themes for the next month)           |\n| Video                          | 1 per month Near end of month  | Feature demos Finwell topics Testimonials                                                                                                                                  |\n\n#### \n\n#### Q2 themes and inputs\n\nWe create a theme for each month to anchor our articles and communications to an overall goal, strategy, occasion, or mindset.

We will also keep an eye on prior month's metrics to spot any trends.\n\n**Article opens (Lookr)**\n\n- Average # unique opens per article in Top 10\n- % increase or decrease of each, current year to previous year\n- % increase or decrease of each, current month to previous month\n\n| Month   |   2024 Unique Avg Opens | Prior Month  Avg Opens   |   2025 Goal  Avg Opens | 2025 Actual Avg Opens    |\n|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| APRIL   |                     9.3 | 27.6                     |                   10.7 |                          |\n| MAY     |                    13.8 |                          |                   15.9 |                          |\n| JUNE    |                     7.8 |                          |                    9   |                          |\n\n**Benefit redirects, suggestions (Lookr)**\n\n- Suggestion rate %\n- % increase or decrease of each, current year to previous year\n- % increase or decrease of each, current month to previous month\n\n| Month   | 2024  % | Avg.   | Prior Month  % | Avg.   | 2025 Goal  % | Avg.   | 2025 Actual  % | Avg.   |\n|---------|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| APRIL   | 61% | 5          | 61% | 18                | 70% | 6               |                         |\n| MAY     | 35% | 2.5        |                         | 40% | 3               |                         |\n| JUNE    | 56% | 4.8        |                         | 56% | 5.5             |                         |\n\n**Email opens and CTR (OneSignal)**\n\n- Open rate %\n- Click-through-rate (CTR)\n- % increase or decrease of each, current year to previous year\n- % increase or decrease of each, current month to previous month\n\n| Month   | 2024  Open | CTR   | Prior Month  Open | CTR   | 2025 Goal  Open | CTR   | 2025 Actual  Open | CTR   |\n|---------|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|\n| APRIL   | 37% | 0.20%        | 26% | 68%                 | 42% | 1%                |                           |\n| MAY     | 39% | 4.8%         |                           | 45% | 1%                |                           |\n| JUNE    | 77% | 0.5%         |                           | 88% | 1%                |                           |\n\n**Push notifications (OneSignal)**\n\n- Click-through-rate (CTR)\n- % increase or decrease of each, current year to previous year\n- % increase or decrease of each, current month to previous month\n\n| Month   | 2024 CTR   | Prior Month CTR   | 2025 Goal CTR   | 2025 Actual CTR   |\n|---------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| APRIL   | TBD        | 0.88%             | TBD             |                   |\n| MAY     | TBD        |                   | TBD             |                   |\n| JUNE    | TBD        |                   | TBD             |                   |\n\nView content metrics for Paven in our [Metrics > Content folder on OneDrive](https:/ustglobal.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/Paven-all/Shared%20Documents/Paven-all/Metrics/Content%20metrics?csf=1&web=1&e=wERYli) .\n\n#### Product content\n\n**Product content** refers to the substance and structure of words and images in our Paven app and website. We collaborate with our product, design and engineering partners to create new and enhanced product features from strategy to execution.\n\nThis quarter, we will be focused on these features, which all help with personalization:\n\n- [Profile builder](https:/roundfeather-paven.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/P3/pages/1363902496/Profile+builder+Personalized+Benefits+page) \u2013 Provide launch support as needed.\n- [Vertical article layout](https:/roundfeather-paven.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/P3/pages/1536655362/Vertical+article+layout) \u2013 Finalize designs based on research, collab with team on future CMS enhancements to make vertical articles even easier (faster) to upload.\n- [Global nav (IA redesign)](https:/roundfeather-paven.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/P3/pages/1651605527/Global+nav+test+planning) \u2013 Support user research effort to gauge effectiveness of protype options, finalize designs and content for winning prototype.\n- [Wellness score](https:/roundfeather-paven.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/P3/pages/1243119625/Wellness+Score+in+UI) \u2013 Collaborate with team on MVP strategy and designs for surfacing a wellness score within the app.\n\n#### Experimentations\n\nContinue running tests and creating learning cards for experiments as tracked here: [Paven experiment tracking.xlsx](https:/ustglobal.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/Paven-all/Shared%20Documents/Paven-all/Research/Experiments/Paven%20experiment%20tracking.xlsx?d=w7c8b5eba172e4aa4aee72481270f7c82&csf=1&web=1&e=2hShUl)\n\nNew experiments to be defined and added for Q2:\n\n- **Segmented communication** (link TBD) \u2013 Create an experiment for running segmented communication tests to user cohorts. We may create cohorts based on one or some of the following:\n    - New users\n    - Users with idle goals\n    - Age groups\n    - Profile question tags\n    - Research panel comms\n\n### Appendix\n\n#### Articles\n\n#### Articles are our main method for engaging users on a regular basis. They inform, coach, and inspire users to make positive behavioral changes for their financial and overall wellness.\n\nFlex push \u2026\n\n#### Benefit spotlight\n\n#### A key differentiator for Paven from competition is our access to Meta-provided benefits content. Our monthly benefit spotlight shines a light on one benefit provider or plan in the context of our monthly theme or other hot topic.\n\n- Success metrics: Our goal for benefit spotlights is to increase benefit redirects for the provider/plan in the spotlight. We will compare metrics from:\n    - 12 month rolling average\n    - Prior year, same month\n- Timing: Benefit spotlights are sent at the beginning of the month, as a kick-off to our theme.\n- Channels: Paven article, push notification, and email comms\n\n#### Paven Poll\n\nHow we're boosting personalization and segmentation through content efforts:\n\n- Polls \u2013 We use answers from our poll questions to identify trends and topics that are of interest to our users. When an article has been influence by a poll, we track it. We also track overall poll results to track trends over time.\n\n#### Videos\n\nVideos on our wish list so far:\n\n- Retirement video\n- Can do screen capture when QA'd in UAT\n- Start of next sprint: Scripting and feedback, planning\n- Start of sprint on March 27 is screen capture and editing\n- April launch of video\n- Note from Leif to focus on for profile builder video \u2013 this is key to personalization.\n- May launch of video\n- Manage debt goal\n- Buy a home goal\n- Wellness score\n- Kids' education goal\n- Budget/Wallet\n- Journeys (how to overall, journey preview video?, then one per journey \u2013 like relocating)\n\nTypes of videos:\n\n- Feature videos\n- Topic videos (videos, Q&As)\n\nVideo content strategy: [draft](https:/ustglobal.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/Paven-all/Shared%20Documents/Paven-all/Planning%20%26%20Strategy/Video%20content%20strategy%20DRAFT.docx?d=wf793f68a2257424a8e2bbbecac88d995&csf=1&web=1&e=p9p945)"}{"name": "Q2 content strategy.docx", "content_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "size": 54705, "data": {}, "collection_name": "10ca88a4-9abd-406c-8649-fa1d662007d4"}nullhí\ˆNﬁ’ÈG  U¡·        UUÅIÅoÇóCÉChí\∏fdd17998-f641-491a-833d-47e19c7eeb28a54e815a-10d9-434a-bfda-d1aa9015facb86bc05f7ca611a887a22a152050fa558eb28885001914c9545a53750364da9ebPaven Content Style Guide.docx/Users/287096/open-webui/backend/data/uploads/fdd17998-f641-491a-833d-47e19c7eeb28_Paven Content Style Guide.docx{"content": "**About Paven**\n\nPaven is here to empower your financial future.

Our voice is approachable, expert, and human. We meet people where they are\u2014whether they're feeling uncertain, empowered, curious, or overwhelmed. And we help them move forward with purpose.\n\nWe don't just deliver information. We help people feel supported, seen, and capable. Every interaction is a chance to build trust and offer clarity.\n\nAt Paven, our voice reflects who we are: clear, kind, and committed to helping people feel confident about their finances. We speak like a trusted guide, one who respects your time, meets you where you are, and helps you move forward with purpose.\n\nWe don't use jargon. We don't lecture. We write the way we'd talk to someone we care about\u2014someone smart, busy, and maybe a little overwhelmed.\n\nWe keep our voice consistent and adjust our tone to fit the moment: encouraging when someone is stuck, celebratory when they reach a goal, calm when things feel uncertain.\n\nAt Paven, we talk to people, not users. Our voice is approachable, expert, and human. We meet people where they are\u2014whether they're feeling uncertain, empowered, curious, or overwhelmed.\n\nWe don't just deliver information. We help people feel supported, seen, and capable. Every interaction is a chance to build trust and offer clarity.\n\nOur voice is:\n\n- Friendly and accessible, but not overly casual\n- Helpful and knowledgeable, but not salesy or pushy\n- Expert, but not know-it-all (watch the jargon!)\n- Fun, but not slapstick or childish\n- Encouraging and empowering but never pushy\n\n#### Our Voice Is\u2026\n\n**Supportive** We champion progress, not perfection. Our tone should feel steady and trustworthy\u2014never critical, salesy, or pushy. When people are anxious about money, we respond with reassurance and next steps.\n \u2705 You're not behind\u2014you're just getting started.\n \u2705 Let's take this one step at a time.\n \ud83d\udeab You should already have this set up.\n\n**Warm and grounded** We use language that feels thoughtful, not mechanical. We don't overdo it with exclamation points or overly casual slang, but we do write with heart. We believe in financial wellness as a deeply human experience.\n \u2705 Here's how to make your plan feel more doable.\n \u2705 This might feel overwhelming\u2014but you're not alone.\n \ud83d\udeab Crush your goals fast!\n\n**Clear and confident** We aim to make complex topics feel manageable. We explain things simply without oversimplifying. Our confidence comes from clarity, not fluff.\n \u2705 You'll see your estimated savings right here.\n \u2705 We use your responses to suggest next steps.\n \ud83d\udeab With our cutting-edge tools, we promise top-tier results.\n\n**Our Voice Is:**\n\n**Grounded** We speak with clarity and confidence.

That comes through in every word. We write like someone who's genuinely on your side.\n\n**Empowering** We speak with optimism and belief in our audience's potential. We simplify the complex, offer small steps forward, and remind people of their progress.\n\n**Intentional** We never use 10 words when 6 will do. Every sentence has a job\u2014to inform, guide, or uplift. We respect our audience's time and attention.\n\n**Emotionally aware** Money is personal. Our content reflects that. We approach sensitive topics like debt, overspending, or financial fear with care and without judgment.\n\n#### Tone Flexes Based on the Moment\n\n**When someone is just starting out** Use an encouraging, welcoming tone. Be clear and gentle.\n \u2705 Let's build your financial picture together.\n \u2705 Not sure where to start? Try this quick check-in.\n\n**When someone's made progress** Celebrate with them\u2014keep it motivating, not over the top.\n \u2705 Way to go\u2014this is real momentum.\n \u2705 Look at how far you've come.\n\n**When someone is stuck or uncertain** Slow things down.

We don't scold.\n \ud83d\udeab You should've planned better\n \u2705 Unexpected expenses come up\u2014here's what you can do\n\n**Overuse of humor or casual tone:** We stay human, not silly. A little lightness is fine, but don't risk misunderstanding.\n\n**How We Build Trust with Our Voice**\n\n- We talk with, not at. We avoid lectures, technical jargon, or financial gatekeeping.\n- We acknowledge emotions. Money brings up fear, joy, hope, shame\u2014and we don't shy away from that.\n- We simplify, not oversimplify. We explain things clearly, without dumbing it down.\n- We use \"you\" more than \"we.\" This is about the reader's journey\u2014not our brand.\n\n**Writing Principles**\n\n**1. Lead with clarity** Open with the \"why it matters\" or \"what to do next.\" Don't bury key actions or ideas.\n\n**2. Guide with empathy** Use language that anticipates stress points, then offers reassurance and direction.\n\n**3. Avoid fluff** Be helpful. Say what you mean. Every sentence should add value.\n\n**4. Don't shy away from complexity\u2014but make it human** We deal in financial systems, yes\u2014but we explain them in plain language with a steady, human tone.\n\n**5. Progress over perfection** We meet people where they are. We don't guilt or shame. We offer a path forward.\n\n**Examples**\n\n\u2705 **Yes**\n\n- \"You're making progress, even if it doesn't feel like it today.\"\n- \"Here's how to get started\u2014no finance degree required.\"\n- \"Looking for your next step? Let's find it together.\"\n\n\ud83d\udeab **No**\n\n- \"Your balance is below threshold. Please review spending behavior.\"\n- \"Incorrect entry. Please enter valid data.\"\n- \"We recommend reviewing your budgetary flow.\"\n\nHere's a revised version of your **Editorial Style & Usage** section, rewritten for **Paven at UST** with an aligned tone\u2014clear, warm, and grounded in a helpful user-first mindset:\n\n### \u270f\ufe0f Editorial Style & Usage\n\nAt Paven, we follow the **AP Stylebook** as our primary editorial reference. That said, language is always evolving\u2014so we also stay flexible. We adapt our style when more inclusive, modern, or intuitive approaches emerge from credible sources (like Stack Exchange or plainlanguage.gov).\n\nOur goal is clarity, consistency, and care in everything we write.\n\n#### How We Address the Reader\n\nAs a team, here's one thing we're actively aligning on: **how we talk to our audience** .\n\nIn some of our content, we've used \"we\" in a broad, collective sense (as in: \"We all want to retire comfortably\"). In other places, we speak more directly to the user using \"you.\"\n\nWe'd like to move intentionally toward **writing to the reader directly** .\n\nWhy? Because it's more personal, more engaging, and more aligned with how we want Paven to feel: like a conversation with someone you trust.\n\n#### Example\n\nInstead of this:\n\nWe all have a timeline in mind for when we'd like to retire. But sometimes career shifts or market changes can slow down progress.\n\nTry this:\n\nYou might have a timeline in mind for when you'd like to retire, but life has a way of shifting those plans. Let's explore how to keep moving forward when things change.\n\nUsing \"you\" puts the focus where it belongs: on the reader and their journey. That's core to our voice\u2014and our mission at Paven.\n\n### \u270d\ufe0f Formatting\n\nAt Paven, we keep formatting clean, intentional, and accessible. Our goal is always clarity. Visual styling should never compete with the message\u2014it should support it. Use formatting to guide attention, not to decorate. When in doubt, keep it simple.\n\n#### Acronyms & Abbreviations\n\nWhen introducing a term for the first time, write it out fully and include the acronym in parentheses\u2014unless it's widely known (like IRS, PIN, or ZIP). Use standard, recognizable abbreviations and avoid inventing your own.\n\n\u2705 Your Employer Identification Number (EIN) is assigned by the IRS.\n \u2705 SLAs, CPAs\n \u2705 Ref. no.\n \u2705 $29/mo\n\n\ud83d\udeab Invoice #\n \ud83d\udeab QBO trial\n \ud83d\udeab e.g., i.e.\n \ud83d\udeab mon, mth, qtr\n\nUse a lowercase \"s\" (no apostrophe) for plural abbreviations. And skip Latin abbreviations like *e.g.* \u2014say *for example* instead.\n\n#### Addresses\n\nFollow regional address conventions and keep them clear. Use standard abbreviations only when necessary for layout or space.\n\n**U.S. example** Jordan Rivera\n 456 Birch Lane\n Seattle, WA 98104\n\n**Canada** Taylor Kim\n Suite 220\n 91 King St.\n Toronto, ON M5H 1A1\n\n**UK** Flat 5B\n 33 Oakwood Road\n Sheffield\n S10 2AU\n\nAvoid excessive abbreviations or symbols unless space demands it.\n\n#### Bold\n\nUse bold to guide, not overwhelm. Bold is helpful for highlighting actions, interface elements, or key identifiers\u2014but only when necessary.\n\n\u2705 Select **Continue** to move forward.\n \u2705 Your invoice **#2045** is now ready.\n \u2705 Open the **Goals** tab to get started.\n\n\ud83d\udeab **Select Continue** to move forward.\n \ud83d\udeab Mixing bold and color or indentation\n\nOne emphasis is enough. Don't combine bold with another style (like indentation, caps, or color).\n\n#### Capitalization\n\nUse sentence case\u2014everywhere. That includes titles, headers, and buttons.\n\n\u2705 Set your budget\n \u2705 Track your spending habits\n \u2705 Paven Financial Check-In\n\n\ud83d\udeab Set Your Budget\n \ud83d\udeab Track Your Spending Habits\n \ud83d\udeab Financial Tools Overview\n\nReserve capitalization for product names, official titles, or proper nouns. Avoid title case unless required in legal references or interface constraints.\n\n#### Italics\n\nAvoid italics in interface copy or instructions. They reduce readability, especially on screen. Use bold instead for emphasis or when pointing to a button, label, or UI element.\n\n#### Links\n\nKeep links purposeful and clear. Don't overload a page with them. Use links to lead the user to another helpful action\u2014not just because you can.\n\n\u2705 Learn more about Paven's financial wellness tools.\n \u2705 [Download your annual report]\n \u2705 Need support? [Contact our team]\n\nAvoid linking entire sentences or multiple phrases to the same page. Inline links should be underlined for accessibility. Standalone buttons don't need underlines if they already look interactive.\n\n#### Lists\n\nLists should make things easier to scan\u2014not harder. Stick to one list per screen or section if possible, and keep it to 3\u20135 items. Use:\n\n- **Bulleted lists** for features or non-ordered items\n- **Numbered lists** for steps or instructions\n\n\u2705 To review your plan:\n\n- Open the app\n- Select \"My Goals\"\n- Tap \"Progress\"\n\n\ud83d\udeab Switch between full sentences and fragments\n \ud83d\udeab Use inconsistent verbs or punctuation\n \ud83d\udeab Stack lists close together\n\n#### Mathematical Symbols\n\nSpell it out when needed. If you're using a math equation, explain it clearly first so screen readers and all users can follow.\n\n\u2705 Add your income after taxes, then divide by your total liabilities.\n \u2705 (Net income + non-cash expenses) \u00f7 liabilities = solvency ratio\n\n\ud83d\udeab 2.5x growth\n \ud83d\udeab Use + for \"and\"\n\nUse \"multiplied by\" or \"divided by\" instead of math symbols in running text.

It increases how much you owe and gets worse as time passes. However, it is extremely beneficial for investments, since it multiplies growth there too.                                                                                                                 |\n| 2      | What is the avalanche method?                     | This is another way to describe the \"high-interest first\" strategy. You make steady payments on debts in order of highest interest and are shielded from paying extra, even just by slowly chipping away.                                                                                                                      |\n| 3      | How else can I make progress on credit card debt? | Another way to look at credit card debt is to start at the beginning \u2013 the purchase. Consider how you can bend your spending and saving habits to fit your debt goals. For instance, building up savings or emergency funds over time can cover what would otherwise require borrowing. The shift takes time, but is worth it. |\n| 4      | I'm worried. What if I've borrowed too much?      | Stress about debt is completely normal \u2013 owing money never feels good!  Consider talking to someone about how your debt makes you feel, and know that there is always a way forward. If you act on tangible steps and expect the surprises along the way, you will make it to the other side.                                  |\n| 5      | Can I use an investment to protect me from debt?  | You want to be careful relying on them, but your investments can be a debt stormwall, especially during inflationary times. Consider moving funds to sectors that tend to match or outpace the rate of inflation, like real estate, and then leverage them to help you get out of a debt jam.                                  |\n\n| Part 3: Overview                                             | Part 3: Overview                                             | Part 3: Overview                                             | Part 3: Overview                                             |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Feature statement Explore > Action Cards Push Notification 3 | Feature statement Explore > Action Cards Push Notification 3 | Feature statement Explore > Action Cards Push Notification 3 | Feature statement Explore > Action Cards Push Notification 3 |\n\n| Article Feature: Key statement   | Article Feature: Key statement   | Article Feature: Key statement   | Article Feature: Key statement   | Article Feature: Key statement   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| [Short Description \u2013 /55]        | [Short Description \u2013 /55]        | [Short Description \u2013 /55]        | [Short Description \u2013 /55]        | [Short Description \u2013 /55]        |\n\n| Explore section: Action Cards                                                                                                 | Explore section: Action Cards                                                                                                 | Explore section: Action Cards                                                                                                 | Explore section: Action Cards                                                                                                 | Explore section: Action Cards                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Action Card \u2013 Frame                                                                                                           | Action Card \u2013 Frame                                                                                                           | Action Card \u2013 Frame                                                                                                           | Action Card \u2013 Frame                                                                                                           | Action Card \u2013 Frame                                                                                                           |\n| [Header \u2013 ]  Explore more of Paven  [Subheader \u2013 ] What's new?
