OK.\nAny quick questions before we dive right in?\n\n\nAlison   0:12\nNo, I'm excited to do this.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   0:14\nAwesome, great. Yay.\nOh, happy to hear that.\nSo to start off, just kind of a a little ice breaker. What is your official role at at Meta?\n\n\nAlison   0:26\nYeah, I'm a technical recruiter. I've been with meta for nine years.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   0:30\nAwesome. 09 years. Wow, that's awesome.\n\n\nAlison   0:32\nYeah, that's well.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   0:34\nIf you could so you could.\nKind of like very briefly, like in a few words, kind of like your major responsibilities in this technical recruiter role.\nWhat would you say those are?\n\n\nAlison   0:47\nI basically hire folks to work in our data center strategy and sustainably in Net Zero team.\nSo my role is to ultimately I'm kind of the closer, so I chat with folks at the full loop stage and and if we get to offer then ioffer them the job and negotiate and get them to start at meta.\nSo that's the layman, probably in terms of the role, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   1:09\nI see.\nMakes sense. Makes sense.\n\n\nAlison   1:12\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   1:13\nI am following.\nOK, awesome. And then kind of zooming out a little bit in terms of, you know, Pavan really an app centred on finances and benefits.\nSo what would you say are your kind of main financial priorities at the moment?\nWhat's really top of mind for you right now?\n\n\nAlison   1:35\nYeah.\nReally, it's about probably saving for some house upgrades and also just prioritizing lifestyle as I just had a kid last year.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   1:47\nCongratulations.\n\n\nAlison   1:48\nThank you.\nYeah. So we we have the 529, but I think it's more of just thinking through our our long term plan for being a family, you know and and think about financial aspects and that and how our budget changes.\nBut I think really the specific is just saving.\nSome cash for home projects.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:09\nGotcha. Gotcha.\nAwesome. What kind of home projects are you hoping to do? If you don't me asking?\n\n\nAlison   2:13\nWe we have to get our roof.\nWell, we've gotten the roof budget done.\nSo that's gonna be done.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:17\nOK. Gotcha. My parents just went through that themselves.\n\n\nAlison   2:18\nYeah, really excited about that goal.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:22\nYeah, I remember that.\n\n\nAlison   2:22\nYeah.\nSo yeah, we got that budget done.\nReally, it's about remodeling our master bathroom.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:30\nOK.\n\n\nAlison   2:31\nTrying to make it that we don't go into debt for anything and that's important thing. And just in general.\nBut yeah, like probably in about 5 years remodeling our master bathroom.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:42\nGotcha. Nice.\nNice. OK.\nSo like you're you're budgeting it out, you're planning when it can happen.\nThat sort of thing, OK.\n\n\nAlison   2:48\nYeah, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:49\nNice, smart, smart.\nI got all things for me to keep in mind.\n\n\nAlison   2:53\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:56\nAnd you know of, I assume that your financial priorities have kind of changed a bit over the years. So kind of from when you first started at meta to now, how have those priorities shifted?\n\n\nAlison   3:10\nOh my God, it's so crazy.\nSo, you know, I think before meta, you know I had a 401K and I had that from previous employers had always been focused on that from when I was like 20 years old.\nLike, thank God, my dad like told me to invest a far one case.\nSo I always had the retirement fund.\nI wanna say that it was probably closer to 20-19, maybe 2020 when I started. Like really think through.\nInvesting outside of my retirement fund.\nYou know, I had met my husband, now husband at that around that time and it was thinking through like couple.\nConversations around finances and then in 2021 we were looking at buying a house and it was just kind of like, honestly, it was more just luck of the draw that I hadn't sold any meta stock that like, helped us with our down payment. And so that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   4:00\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   4:03\nWas interesting 'cause.\nThat definitely helped.\nBut then when I look back on it, I'm thinking about like taxes then and I started looking into like.\nMy RSU tags and how it's taxed as income and you know, as a recruiter I have those conversations with candidates, but I don't think it was until that time that I really kind of was deep diving into how I think about leveraging my Rs use.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   4:23\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   4:23\nThe past few years, it's been more about since we've we bought the house.\nIt it's it's funny to think back on like your timeline, but I think now it's like really it was building the emergency fund and emergency fund in line with repairing a roof.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   4:38\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   4:40\nSo it was a lot more cash heavy focus there the past year or so. And now I think priority is stacking cash, but like less more so as an emergency fund since I feel like we have a pretty solid emergency fund set up.\nLike probably about six months in cash to keep us good.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   4:59\nOh wow, that's awesome.\n\n\nAlison   5:00\nYeah, and like and that's it's been.\nIt's it's fascinating to me, 'cause. I like think back and I was not in that mindset nine years ago.\nLike it's just and Paven has definitely helped me with different areas, but yeah, so that's kind of where we're at now.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   5:07\nYeah.\n\n\nAlison   5:12\nSo I feel like we've got a pretty good like nest egg and I think now it's like being intentional around spending and thinking through like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   5:13\nMm hmm.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   5:22\nI mean, honestly, I work for meta, but like my outside of work. Like when do I get to like, retire early?\nType not like full fire movement, which I'm sure you've heard, but like just like a little bit of like time flexibility like this.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   5:31\nYep, Yep.\n\n\nAlison   5:36\nBeen with my son, so focusing more on that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   5:38\nMm hmm.\nGotcha. Gotcha. OK. Yeah, so lots.\nWhich, you know, makes sense.\nLots of devolved over the years.\nBut all very important stuff.\nI think so.\nWhen I say the term financial well-being.\nWhat does that mean to you?\nWhat does that look like for you?\n\n\nAlison   6:02\nYeah, I mean it.\nThat feels good.\nLike in first I feel like I have a good financial well-being.\nWhat I think through that is that I we never we don't have any debt outside of our mortgage and that was a really big picture for us.\nOh, paying off, my son. My husband's student loans last year was also a focus.\nSo I think you know, I think having no debt besides the mortgage is a big one.\nI think that being able to know that if something were to happen, because that's a reality for us, like we'd be able to be OK for a couple of months from a financial perspective.\nAnd I think time freedom is kind of important to me.\nAnd like I'm, I'm grateful to have the job, but I think long term being able to have enough financial stability that I could walk away for an extended period of time before finding something else. And that's like a five year six year plan.\nSo don't tell my meta managers that that's on the horizon, but yeah, but that's kind of how I think about it.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   7:03\nNo, of course your secret is safe with me.\n\n\nAlison   7:05\nYeah, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   7:06\nYep. Yep, Yep. OK. OK.\nThat's awesome. Great.\nAnd.\nYou know, how have you sort of?\nKind of gotten to this place of like feeling in really good shape when it comes to financial well-being.\n\n\nAlison   7:23\nHigh income increased and you know I was promoted and I started to you know I was getting, I got married in 2022. So you know, when I met my husband, it was like we're a very different financial experiences. And so I think like coming together early.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   7:25\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   7:39\nOn about what that looked like, combining finances like budgeting appropriately, I still don't think like we budget well, but thankfully like we have enough cash. So we can like play around with things on a monthly basis and like I feel really grateful for that.\nBut it's not something that I hold like really stringent to.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   7:56\nYep, Yep.\n\n\nAlison   7:57\nAnd so I think that's a big one in terms of like my income is definitely increased.\nI've got promoted twice and I think be really intentional about like where my paycheck goes in terms of like it goes to like 5 different accounts.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   8:12\nYeah.\n\n\nAlison   8:13\nLike three of them are savings accounts like what we call, what we call the sinking funds, right?\nLike travel, the bathroom remodel like, and I've been really intentional about that.\nI wanna say the past like.\nTwo to three years.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   8:24\nGotcha. Gotcha.\nOK.\nThat's awesome.\nAnd then kind of on the the flip side of of what paven kind of tackles being, but still kind of tied being benefits?\nI assume as a recruiter you might have a little bit of a better kind of understanding of the benefit landscape. Would you say that's accurate?\n\n\nAlison   8:44\nYeah.\nDefinitely.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   8:47\nYep, Yep.\nAnd So what are some of the, I guess, thinking about how it ties to your financial well-being as well?\nLike what are some of kind of the top meta benefits that you utilize?\nThat really help you there.\n\n\nAlison   9:01\nYeah, I mean, we used the.\nProgeny benefit to have our child. I use Cleo regularly in his first year of life.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   9:07\nOK. Yep.\n\n\nAlison   9:13\nI had a career coach with Lyra for a little bit over a year.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   9:17\nThanks.\n\n\nAlison   9:20\nI think that was like those are the main ones from a benefit perspective. I mean like the the well-being, the Wellness benefit, the $2000 that we give like that's.\nThis kind of range like I've used it for like my dog's daycare and then like I bought a kayak like now I'm using it for like my son's museum like, you know, so like, I feel like that's a good benefit. But like, it's just something that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   9:38\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   9:41\nKind of fluid, but yeah, the being able to have our son be IVF and progeny was huge.\nAnd Clio was huge in the past year of just like motherhood. So.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   9:47\nMm hmm.\nYes, right. Yeah.\nThat's awesome.\nThat's awesome.\nThat's some great benefits.\nI was actually.\nWe were doing a push the other day for it the the Lyra benefit.\nEffort I believe.\nSo I was reading more about that and I was like, oh, very nice, nice.\n\n\nAlison   10:03\nYeah, it's, it's great.\nYeah, I always thought of it as like it's therapy.\nBut then when?\nI like went because I I didn't feel like I needed therapy.\nThen this was a couple years ago. Like I didn't feel like I had childhood trauma to work through.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:12\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   10:16\nBut then I was like, OK, let me see, you know, like, we're going through this like IVF and like, trying to figure out stuff with my husband. And like, this is an interesting time.\nSo when I signed up, it was like therapy or career coaching or like life coaching. And I was like.\nLife coaching like I didn't know there was a benefit, but that's awesome.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:29\nThat, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   10:31\nLike that's kind of how I'm thinking about this.\nAnd I was with her for about a year and a half, and it was amazing. So.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:37\nAmazing, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   10:39\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:39\nYeah, that's really awesome.\nDefinitely like life coaching is something like even on my social media and everything like it's something that I'm seeing come up a lot more and I'm like, you know, there's something there.\n\n\nAlison   10:46\nYeah, people need it.\nPeople need it, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:47\nI think, yeah.\nAwesome. OK.\nGreat, so now I kinda wanna spend the rest of our time.\nKind of diving into the pavement app and your experience with it.\n\n\nAlison   10:58\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:59\nSo I guess to start, how long have you been using Pavan for?\n\n\nAlison   11:04\nI think they could have like a couple of like many years. Like I want to say at least six years.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   11:10\nGotcha. OK.\n\n\nAlison   11:11\nIf that makes sense, because I I think when I really started because like I'm not sure when like the fire movement for me started about, I feel like it was around 2020 or like seeing those types of things and it was like, oh, like I definitely Don.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   11:19\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   11:22\nThink I'm there, but like I'm interested in deep dive more into my finances and I think that I probably leveraged it more starting then and obviously a different goal.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   11:31\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   11:32\nSo that was interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   11:37\nSo.\nWhen you first started using Paven, what would you say?\nWere your expectations for the product and what it would, it would help you with and do for you?\n\n\nAlison   11:54\nI definitely.\nI definitely thought it was gonna be like more of a budgeting tool, and I don't think I'd ever use one.\nAnd I I remember that being really crystal clear when I jumped into it because the one thing that I did appreciate, it was the different articles that were in there and the way that they're situated is like kind of telling a story.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:08\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   12:13\nI really appreciated that and I remember just kind of like reading, like ferociously the different articles, even if I like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:16\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   12:21\nLike when I think back 2020, 2019-2020.\nI had no vision of buying a home, you know, and that wasn't even on my radar.\nAnd then it was, oh, this is interesting.\nLike there's an article around like what that might look like, or how we think about that. And so it I was pleasantly surprised by that in terms of the amount of information that was on there.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:41\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   12:42\nAnd you know, I saw the the goals that popped up and I I kinda played around with it, but I don't think that I really deep dived into that maybe until a couple years ago.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:53\nGotcha. Gotcha.\n\n\nAlison   12:54\nLike a year and a half ago.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:56\nSo what?\nWhat goal was it that a couple years ago that you started diving into more?\n\n\nAlison   13:01\nIt was probably the emergency fund and like buying a home.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   13:04\nGotcha. Mm hmm mm hmm.\nGotcha.\nSo.\nSo in AI, guess in that sense like it was.\nYou know, cuz we, you know, there is a budgeting tool in pavement, of course.\nBut there's also the articles as well.\nSo, like, how would you say like overall the app kind of aligns with your expectations or meets it or, you know, does something else?\n\n\nAlison   13:34\nYeah, the the last time I did want to touch on is I've talked to a coach multiple times and that is a huge benefit. Like I I'll typically start with the chat just because like I'm so busy that I'm just like, oh, I have a quick question like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   13:37\nMm hmm.\nOh, nice, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   13:47\nLet me just jump into the chat and the first time that I did that was probably about like two years ago and the guy was so nice.\nHe's like, do you wanna jump on a call?\nLike it just be more so much easier.\nAnd that was the first time I'd ever talked to a financial person.\nI don't know if they're called financial advisors, but like somebody that like had that type of mentality.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   14:01\nMm hmm.\nYes.\n\n\nAlison   14:06\nAnd I was just, you know, it was a little just kind of like, oh, my God, like, how do we have this benefit 'cause? It was the most fruitful conversation I'd ever had in terms of finances.\nAnd then.\nEarlier this year, as we were thinking about taxes, because last year was absolutely insane from an income perspective.\nAnd the stocks?\nI jumped on a call with a person and then she was amazing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   14:26\nMm H.\n\n\nAlison   14:30\nAnd then she said, you know, we could probably do this again in June. And like, you know, you're gonna like stack your 401K.\nK and like we had this plan. And so then we're meeting again in June and I was like, I don't even know this is an option like this is incredible. So.\nThat is actually probably like one of the biggest things that I love about the app is talking to folks.\nTo kinda go back to your question of how I look at the app now, it's tough for me because I think the feedback that I gave was that the goals are just out of line to what my goals are now.\nSo when I look at that, it's like the two things that are I'm like in there right now.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   14:59\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   15:03\nIt's like consider buying a home or pay off your bad debts.\nWell, I don't have I.\nI don't need either of those.\nAnd so it was just kind of like, why is that there?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   15:08\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   15:10\nLike it's not as relevant. I feel like it would be better if like.\nThere was a list of goals that you could just choose from it, and maybe that exists, but at first glance that's what I'm seeing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   15:18\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   15:20\nAnd so maybe if there was a way that I could be like already bought a home, you know, no debt or something like that to make it like a little bit more focused. That's kind of one thing that I'm looking at.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   15:30\nMm hmm.\nSo then what's like looking at kind of the slate of goals and thinking about where you are now?\nWhat are one or two goals that you would like to see added to the pavement that you could see yourself taking advantage of at this moment?\n\n\nAlison   15:55\nI don't.\nI don't know 'cause. I'm like. I'm like, looking at the life path, which I also really like 'cause. It was like a kind of like a check like box almost for me.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   15:59\nGotcha. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   16:05\nAnd that's I think where I kind of stopped because it was like starting with like hey, your age, like your path and then it's like consider buying a home.\nIt's like, well, I already did that.\nFill your emergency fund. OK, I already did that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   16:18\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   16:18\nMy retirement is like technically at risk from them, but like, I think I'm OK with what I have.\nWhen I think about it, like longevity, like maybe I could look into that but and then send your kid to college. And it's just like, well, I already have a 529, so.\nI don't know, and I think that's what, honestly, what I'm trying to figure out myself from, like a financial perspective like you know it's it's like a good problem to have and I'm grateful that I do. But I think that's a big thing for me is like, OK.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   16:41\nYeah, right.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   16:47\nWhat does this look like?\nAnd I think the other thing is the market is wild and we have to be realistic about that, so.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   16:53\nYep, Yep.\nThinking, I guess a little bit more.\nJust kind of like wishlist like in addition to what exists in the app now like.\nWhat's something that you would?\nLike either a feature that you would love to see from the app, or even more so like what would you need to sort of at this moment, increase your.\nEngagement with the app right now.\n\n\nAlison   17:30\nI think the Community aspect is something that I feel like I'm missing from an app perspective, and I maybe you've heard this, but at mehda there's a couple groups that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   17:33\nMeeting.\n\n\nAlison   17:41\nTalk about financials and like tax, we call it tax avoidance at meta like you know it's a it's a pretty bad title, but it's just it's a group that talks about financial specifics that is just kind of like how do you set yourself up for success and in.\nThat area, and it would be so interesting if, like, there was a community piece where.\nWas like people are kinda sharing ideas. Similarly are like asking questions and then being able to respond.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:04\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   18:07\nSimilarly to what we do internally in the group and it's like OK, well, that would be interesting if we could do that in the app and kind of like take it into that and then tie it back to your specific arena of like what is needed, I I.\nGuess I maybe in a it's been a while since I've actually like jumped into the app because I think it was probably about a maybe six months ago when I chatted with a lady, but then also it's just like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:27\nMm hmm.\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   18:31\nLike this isn't really giving me a lot of value because I've run all the articles and I feel like my goals are set.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:36\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   18:38\nI feel like we're in a good financial place, so it wasn't like I feel like I'd go to it anymore to learn.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:44\nMm H.\n\n\nAlison   18:44\nBecause I feel like I'm a lot more financially knowledgeable now and have haven't paid in, is definitely a piece of that. And also just like individual research.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:57\nSo Speaking of the community aspect, do you has paven ever come up in conversation with other metamates? Like is it something that you've ever talked about with other folks or?\n\n\nAlison   19:08\nI have absolutely pitched it like to my immediate team and nobody knew about it. And so I think that that was interesting. And so, you know, I think it was earlier this year we were talking about the tax piece and I know that there's another way of like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   19:15\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   19:23\nWe you can like schedule time like as a benefit for taxes, but the person that I talked to in the like the coach was actually really helpful and it was like a little bit less than like directness around like taxes. Like they were, they did.\nAll well, where it wasn't like they were touching other subjects, but I don't think you're allowed to. But. And then I went back to my team and I said 'cause, we were just talking about, like, how we have to pay all these taxes. And I was like you.\nGuys need to use him like it's amazing and like I would say that like 90% of my team hadn't heard about it or hadn't used it and like didn't know it existed and it was just kind of like surprising to me. And I think that's because I.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   19:57\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   20:02\nJust like.\nImmersed myself in this like financial freedom type worlds that I'm like, why wouldn't you be using that?\nMad. And so it was surprising, but I definitely think that was like the feedback that I got.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   20:09\nRight, right.\nOK. Interesting. Also like good to hear 'cause, at least from my perspective, it's kinda hard for me to tell like what exactly how it's coming up in conversation and that sort of thing.\nBut that's awesome and.\n\n\nAlison   20:24\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   20:29\nI so then come kind of coming back to the community aspect.\nLike what?\nI guess what would that kind of look like in your mind if you were kind of drawing that out? Like is it about kind of going through?\nSpecific tasks in Paven together being able to talk about it.\nIs it a sort of like pull scenario where you can see how other folks are responding to questions?\nIs it like actual groups of paven users where you can just talk to each other?\nWhat would that kind of look like for you?\n\n\nAlison   21:02\nI think it would be interesting because I think that where I see a black hole is one people just don't talk about finances, which is totally fine like you have to be like a certain person to like have these types of conversations. But I just would love to.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   21:10\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   21:16\nBe able to understand where my peers are at and like. Maybe it's not that like my direct peers, but it's like, hey, you're kind of in the same boat that I'm in.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   21:20\nMm.\n\n\nAlison   21:25\nWhat's your thought process?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   21:26\nYep, Yep.\n\n\nAlison   21:27\nAnd I've got like one to two friends that I have these types of conversations with.\nBut like.\nIt would be so interesting if I could like connect with somebody else. That's like in a similar boat. Like has a House, has a child like.\nIs working towards maybe financial freedom and like is thinking about what that might look like. And I think that the way that I'm always coming about stuff is I love to learn like I love to read and like understand and like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   21:50\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   21:52\nSo I'm just a total fly on the wall in these groups and like seeing these people talk about this crazy stuff like, you know, as a technical recruiter, I definitely get paid well.\nBut like it's different than like a software engineer at Meta.\nBut I'm. Oh, my God, that's fascinating.\nLike, wow, that situation. You know what I mean?\nSo I think that's where I'm kind of thinking about it.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   22:08\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   22:09\nIt, but I just feel like there's such an opportunity to, like, almost grow with peers knowing that you're like in a similar spot with your finances.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   22:16\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   22:21\nAnd that's a culture thing as well.\nSo I think that's kind of like where it's a little bit more difficult 'cause you have to like be open to those types of conversations which like I said, I'd like one to two friends.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   22:31\nYeah, this this community piece is definitely something that has been very, you know, interesting to us. And like we've been mulling it over for quite some time in terms in terms of like what that would look like in practice and how we'd be able to manage that. So.\nIt's nice to hear that.\nLike, that's also like something that you're looking for is like the ability to really connect with peers.\n\n\nAlison   22:49\nYeah, interesting.\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   22:53\nAlso.\nFor my next sorry, next question was So what other sort of financial products or services or like even like visiting websites or readings etc.\nLike what else is kind of in your ecosystem of tools?\nAnd then how does paven sort of fit into that landscape?\n\n\nAlison   23:21\nYeah, podcast.\nSo I listen to the buddy with Katie show and like religiously and also like read her newsletters.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   23:27\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   23:30\nAnother one is like Instagrams.\nIt's funny.\nI want to say like probably about three or four years ago, I was like, so heavily invested.\nI just like started following a lot of like money influencers and then as I started like learning and like understanding it was almost just like every was saying the same thing.\nAnd then it was like OK then like this person is just like not my vibe.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   23:52\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   23:56\nThis person is and so I think like I've been able to kind of pare it down to my name with Katie, I think has always been one for me and like her starting probably around twenty 20th and she also worked at Meta so.\nYeah. And then.\nFeeling financial freedom?\nIt was like money like Mallory, something I don't know.\nShe is a financial influencer, if that's what we're gonna call it.\nBut she also.\nHas really young kids and so she's kinda talking about the aspects of financial freedom with children and like spending within your values.\nAnd that was really interesting.\nSo I think for my social perspective, those two, the Fidelity newsletter actually sends out a lot of interesting information.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   24:38\nHmm.\n\n\nAlison   24:41\nAnd.\nNerd Wallet sends out some interesting information, except I think it's really annoying that they just like pitch credit cards.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   24:47\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   24:49\nEspecially cause like I don't like. I don't wanna have a lot of consumer debt.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   24:51\nYeah.\n\n\nAlison   24:53\nSo it's just kind of like this is just dumb, but from a research perspective it's nice, but I think those are the like main ones.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   25:00\nMm hmm. Gotcha. OK. Nice. Nice. Nice. OK, great.\nSo I guess kind of to like start kind of at least summing up that paven experience in terms of.\nLike over over the years, I guess. How?\nLike, what's kind of your cadence with going into paven?\nLike, how often have you been like logging into paven over the years? And obviously I, you know, I assume that there might be some fluctuations and changes in there as well.\n\n\nAlison   25:33\nI think I think it was when like something big was happening from a money perspective.\nSo I definitely think during tax season.\nI don't.\nI want it like I don't.\nI don't think this is the case and I'm like was it around Rs us like quarterly? I don't think so.\nI think being like taxes are a big one and then I think it was more probably like every six months, honestly now 'cause, it's just like I don't really.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   25:56\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   25:57\nI don't feel like I have a lot to go into the app to look for because I kind of like have a good sense of where I stand financially.\nSo I'm like, I don't know that I either like go and learn.\nSomething new.\nBecause that's kind of how I used in the past.\nOf like knowledge, right? So.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:13\nRight.\n\n\nAlison   26:16\nNow I'm like looking at it. And I'm like, oh, interesting. Like value based investing like finances, sustainable, like.\nBut I found out about that type of stuff actually from a podcast. That money with Katie did with like in their advisor. And so I'm like, OK, but that's not as relevant.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:26\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   26:29\nSo that's like my immediate reaction.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:32\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   26:33\nSo yeah, I definitely I think from a coaching like because I probably would be opening it to talk to a coach, it'd be around like tax season or like my husband and I kind of go through finances at the beginning of the year.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:40\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   26:43\nSo it's like, OK.\nLet me like check in and see if I can like bring anything more to the table based on conversations with Coach.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:50\nGotcha. Awesome.\nAnd but I guess when you were you when you first downloaded it, like you said about six years ago, I think and you were like starting to read out all those articles, was it more that you were going into paven and and sort of taking advantage of that?\n\n\nAlison   27:06\nYeah, yeah, totally.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:07\nThat type of content. OK, it's nice.\n\n\nAlison   27:09\nYeah, 'cause I was.\nIt was like something new and and it was. And there was always something that was like being posted that was like, oh, I didn't think about that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:12\nYeah.\n\n\nAlison   27:16\nLike, that's interesting. And like I think that's like how it has definitely differed now that I'm more financially savvy, so to speak that that's like why I don't probably use it as often as before.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:24\nMm hmm.\nAnd then So what would you say again?\nJust like kind of ranking a bit like, what would you say is the most useful piece of the pavement app for you?\n\n\nAlison   27:49\nProbably the explorer, because there's still like articles in there that I like. I'm interested in reading.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:52\nMm hmm.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   27:59\nBut it's not like I'm like, needing to go in there and like, learn now. But I think that's that's definitely looking at it now.\nI'm like, oh, it's interesting.\nIt's like more structured a little bit like it looks differently, but I did previously like and I don't when that updates care about like I just in real time kind of like OK.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   28:12\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   28:17\nThat's helpful because like some of those are not relevant to me, but like maybe I could learn more about side hustles even. I don't wanna have a side hustle.\nBut like you know what I mean? Like you can just be knowledgeable.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   28:26\nYeah. And then on the flip side, what would you say is the least kinda useful?\nPiece of it.\n\n\nAlison   28:34\nI don't wanna say it's the goal section 'cause. I think it's nice to have that visibility, but like I do feel like there's a way that like I could set up my goals differently and the life path I feel like just doesn't really do a lot for me.\nLike it's just, I don't know.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   28:54\nWould you say it's because it's like a lack of like ability to kind of individualize, personalized, almost what? Yeah.\n\n\nAlison   29:00\nKind of.\nYeah, I think I think so, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   29:05\nGotcha.\nOK.\nOK.\nAwesome. Really quickly, just to kind of wrap up, I was hoping to kind of go through some of the features within paven and just kind of rank on a scale of one to five like one being least valuable, 5 being most valuable, where you would rank these spec.\n\n\nAlison   29:21\nYes.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   29:29\nFeatures and as you go. Just kind of explain your reasoning out loud.\nAnd we'll go from there.\nThere. So let's start.\nWith.\nDrum roll.\nLet's start with articles.\nOn a scale of one to five, one least five most valuable, where would you put articles?\n\n\nAlison   29:51\nI'm at 5.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   29:53\nGotcha. OK.\nAnd what I guess kind of I 'cause I didn't ask you this point when you brought it up, but like what?\nReally strikes you about the articles in the way that Pavan presents the content.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   30:10\nI think it's like small pieces like it's almost like kind of a snapshot on some of them. And I kind of appreciated that.\nIt was like, hey, like this article is 3 minutes.\nLike OK, I have 3 minutes like let me just like dive into this and then it feels like it's like pretty interactive.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   30:21\nYep.\nRight.\n\n\nAlison   30:27\nI don't.\nMaybe it's the way that it's like visually.\nIt's it's not a ton of information.\nIt's not like I feel like I'm, like, reading this article that like, I'm like going through, which like I would digest that and I'd love that. But I feel like for this, it's like you just kind of scroll through.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   30:39\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   30:42\nAnd it's like seem less.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   30:44\nMm hmm. Yep, Yep. Yep for sure.\nOK. That's great to hear.\nAll right. Next let's say the the polls feature.\nSo where would you put from 1:00 to 5:00? The the polls feature?\n\n\nAlison   30:58\nThe polls feature.\nI don't think I knew that existed.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:00\nYes. Oh, the polls, OK.\nSo yeah, so I don't know. So in the.\nAs of January this year, we started sending out polls in the newsletter as well, but you can also take them in the app.\nSo I think our latest one is.\nIt should have an option to take the poll on the screen.\nLet me see if I can get to it. On my home screen, yes.\nSo if you like go to your home screen and maybe refresh it under your next steps.\nI think the first one is what's your money dial?\n\n\nAlison   31:39\nOh, OK, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:41\nYeah. And so you can take that poll.\nYeah. OK. All right.\n\n\nAlison   31:47\nThat's interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:48\nAnd we send out polls like once a month.\n\n\nAlison   31:48\nI kind of looked at that as like, oh, interesting. OK.\nYeah, I kind of looked at that of like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:52\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   31:55\nIt was just another like goal because there's a lot more of like setup goal and I'm like well, that's not relevant.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:59\nMm hmm. Yep.\n\n\nAlison   32:00\nSo I I don't think I deep dived into that, but that's interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:03\nOK. OK. Nice, nice.\nDo you think that that's a feature that you would explore more if, like a topic came through or that that kind of struck a chord with you?\n\n\nAlison   32:13\nYeah, I think so, for sure, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:17\nAlright, let's Speaking of goals, let's go to goals now. So on from 1:00 to 5:00.\n\n\nAlison   32:21\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:22\nWhere would you put that?\n\n\nAlison   32:24\nProbably like A2.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:26\nGotcha.\nGotcha. OK. And I know we've kind of talked about that.\nJust like again, not being as relevant for you and.\nYeah, like all the boxes kind of being checked.\n\n\nAlison   32:40\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:42\nAnd let's say the the connect with a coach feature.\n\n\nAlison   32:46\nFive whole heartedly.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:48\nMm hmm.\nAwesome love hearing about the great experiences that you've had with the with the coaches.\n\n\nAlison   32:55\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:55\nThat makes me very happy.\n\n\nAlison   32:56\nYeah, I was.\nI was scared to jump on the phone with the first person.\nHe's like, it's so much easier to talk over the phone. If I was chatted, I was like I'm over the phone.\nI was like, Oh my God. Like, how is this a benefit for us like?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:05\nMm.\n\n\nAlison   33:07\nAnd it was amazing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:08\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   33:08\nSo I've never done the tax.\nOh, that's actually maybe some feedback, like the tax specific educator.\nThere's never any options available, so just FYI.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:15\nYep.\nGotcha.\nGotcha. Good to know. Thank you.\nAnd so with the coaching thing like, is that something that you would have kind of? Is that something you could have seen yourself trying to kind of figure out and uncover within the meta landscape without paven or was it just like paven presented it to you you were?\nLike, oh, let me jump on this.\nAnd then it's like, oh, this is really nice.\n\n\nAlison   33:46\nI remember probably Paven presenting it via like one of the benefits updates like they may have done, like a they probably. I remember this they probably did like an event and they shared and I was just like this is amazing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:51\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   34:00\nI need to do this and this probably a little bit like about six years ago, so for however long.\nSo yeah, I think it would have been presented to me and then it actually took me a little bit to actually do the coach thing because I think that I there was a little bit of hesitation because I felt.\nIt wasn't set up with my finances.\nI don't wanna like bring attention to it.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:20\nYep, Yep.\n\n\nAlison   34:21\nAnd then it was like, oh wait, I feel better. Let's talk.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:24\nGotcha. OK, interesting.\nI know the feeling.\nSometimes I'm like even just with my sister.\n\n\nAlison   34:29\nYou're right.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:32\nSometimes 'cause we're kind of and I feel like opposite ends right now. And whenever I start talking, I'm like maybe I won't talk to you right now. That's great.\n\n\nAlison   34:41\nTotally.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:44\nOK, next.\nWhat about the the budget feature?\n\n\nAlison   34:50\nDidn't know it existed and had to find it, so I've never really used it.\nI also use a separate tool for budgeting outside of paven, so that is what is like my day-to-day, which is the copilot app.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   35:00\nHmm.\nGotcha. OK.\nYep. OK, that makes sense.\nWhat about the the Journeys feature?\n\n\nAlison   35:17\nThat I feel like, is that like the life path or which one was the journey?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   35:23\nSo journey.\n\n\nAlison   35:24\nOh, I see your personal guide.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   35:29\nLet's see.\nUmm.\nSo yeah. So the journeys, if you go on the homepage, it's like that icon in between the profile and the search.\nAnd that has a list of the journeys, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   35:43\nYeah.\nI think I've looked at it previously and then that was kind of like how I was feeling about it where it was just like, OK, this is not as relevant, but now that I'm looking at it again, it's like, OK, interesting, like caring for your family like that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   35:54\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   35:56\nIs actually going to be interesting for me. Like, I definitely think that need to think more about like estate planning and like raising kids. So actually I'll probably.\nJump into this and like start some journeys with those that are more relevant to me.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   36:18\nAnd then lastly the newsletter.\nAre you subscribed to the to the newsletter?\n\n\nAlison   36:25\nI don't think so actually.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   36:26\nDon't think so. OK. OK, gotcha.\nIs that something that you could like, see yourself being interested in or what would you and what if so? Like, what would you like to see in a in a pivot newsletter?\n\n\nAlison   36:40\nYeah, totally.\nI think that whatever I look for in the financial newsletters is like real time.\nLike real? Not like real time information, but like the way the world turns, it is quick and like people.\nSituations can also change in different areas, so I feel like what I've really enjoyed from seeing newsletters is like updates on what's happening that matters financially.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:00\nOK.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   37:08\nMore specific, you know what I mean.\nAnd like tariffs are the conversation right now?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:10\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   37:13\nBut like you know what I mean?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:13\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   37:14\nLike I don't.\nI don't know that I wanna see another article on tariffs.\nBut I do not like if it's something like that that's relevant.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:18\nRight.\n\n\nAlison   37:23\nAnd maybe more specific for high earners in tech.\nLike that's interesting.\nYou know what I mean? So.\nI think that might be interesting. Just knowing that we have Haven as a benefit, but.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:36\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   37:38\nJust love to read and like digest stuff, so I'd be open to whatever.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:42\nYeah. Awesome. Awesome.\nWell, we are kind of nearing the end of our time and I don't want to run over before we wrap up.\nDo you have any kind of last questions for me or anything you wish that I had anything you wish I had asked that I didn't get to.\n\n\nAlison   37:54\nNo, this has been great.\nNo, thank you.\nYeah. Appreciate the context and and sharing. I think it's really interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:00\nSo.\n\n\nAlison   38:03\nAnd yeah, it's it's definitely helped me as a tool, so I'm excited to kind of deep dive, maybe a little regularly.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:04\nMm hmm.\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n\nAlison   38:12\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:12\nWe you know this as you know, this kind of pavement research community is something that we started pretty recently and this is our first actually study with members of the PAVAN Research community. And so, you know, part of it is to kind of have a pool for us.\n\n\nAlison   38:18\nOh, OK.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:29\nTo pull from and talk to more regularly as we're kind of in for, you know, going down the product road map, but also we want to keep y'all in the loop as well to kind of share updates about where things.\nAre going and how insights are being kind of translated into the app.\n\n\nAlison   38:43\nI love it. Yeah, that's awesome.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:44\nYeah. Awesome. Awesome.\nWell, thank you so much for being so generous of your time.\nIt was really wonderful to meet you and talk to you, Allison.\n\n\nAlison   38:52\nYeah, you too.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:52\nThank you and have a wonderful holiday weekend.\n\n\nAlison   38:56\nYeah, you too.\nStay. Stay dry out there.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:59\nThanks.

Panelists participate via self -administered web surveys. \nPanelists who do not have internet access at home are provided with a tablet and wireless internet \nconnection. Interviews are conducted in both English and Spanish. The panel is being managed by \nIpsos . \nData in this report is drawn from ATP  Wave 147, which was conducted from April 29 to May 19, \n2024 , among a sample of U.S adults  who have never had children and are unlikely to have children \nin the future. The sample was comprised of 8,826 panelists who had previously indicated that they \ndid not have children and, for those under 50 years old, had also said they were unlikely to ha ve \nchildren in the future. At the start of the survey, respondents were screened and considered \neligible for inclusion if they co nfirmed that they had never been a parent or guardian to any \nchildren, living or deceased, including biological or adopted children. To be considered eligible, \nrespondents under 50 also had to say that they were not too or not at all likely to have childre n in \nthe future. Of the 7,304 respondents who completed the screening questions, there were 3,312 who \nwere eligible and went on to complete the full survey, including 1,779  respondents from the ATP \nand an additional 1,533  from Ipsos' KnowledgePanel (KP) . The survey has a response rate of 82 % \n(AAPOR RR3).6 The cumulative response rate accounting for nonresponse to the recruitment \nsurveys and attrition is 2%. The break -off rate among panelists who logged on to the survey and \ncompleted at least one item is 1%.  \nWeighting and analysis were performed separately for respondents ages 18 to 49 and those 50 and \nolder. The margin of sampling error for the sample of 770 respondents  ages 18 to 49  is plus or \nminus 5.3 percentage points.  The margin of sampling error for the sample of 2,542 respondents \nages 50 and older is plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.  \nPanel recruitment  \nThe ATP was created in 2014 , with the first cohort of panelists invited to join the panel at the end \nof a large, national, landline and cellphone random -digit dial  survey that was conducted in both \nEnglish and Spanish. Two additional recruitments were conducted using the same method in 2015 \n \n6 The response rate is calculated as the number of eligible completes over the sum of eligible completes, breakoffs and nonresp ondents, \nwhere it is estimated that 46% of nonrespondents would have been eligible if they responded. 43 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org and 2017 , respectively. Across these three surveys, a total of 19,718  adults were invited to join the \nATP , of whom  9,942  (50%) agreed to participate.  \nIn August 2018, the ATP switched from telephone to address -based  sampling (ABS) recruitment. \nA study cover letter and a pre -incentive  are mailed  to a stratified, random sample of households \nselected from the U.S. Postal Service's Delivery Sequence File. This Postal Service file has been \nestimated to cover as much as 98% of the population, although some studies suggest that the \ncoverage could be in the low 90% range.7 Within each sampled household, the adult with the next \nbirthday is asked to participate. Other details of the ABS recruitment protocol have changed over \ntime but are available upon request.8  \nWe have recruited a national \nsample of U.S. adults to the \nATP approximately once per \nyear since 2014. In some years, \nthe recruitment has included \nadditional efforts (known as an \n\"oversample\") to boost sample \nsize with underrepresented \ngroups. For example, Hispanic \nadults, Black adults and Asian \nadults were oversampled in \n2019, 2022 and 2023, \nrespectively.  \nAcross the six address -based \nrecruitments, a total of 23,862  \nadults were invited to join the \nATP, of whom 20,917  agreed to \njoin the panel and completed an \ninitial profile survey. Of the \n30,859  individuals who have ever joined the ATP, 11,897  remained active panelists and continued \nto receive survey invitations at the time this survey was conducted.  \n \n7 AAPOR Task Force on Address -based Sampling. 2016. \"AAPOR Report: Address -based Sampling .\" \n8 Email pewsurveys@pewresearch.org .

Panelists also become \ninactive if they ask to be removed from the panel.  \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER 44 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org The American Trends Panel never uses breakout routers or chains that direct respondents to \nadditional surveys.  \nSample design  \nThis survey was designed to cover the population of noninstitutionalized persons ages 18 and older \nliving in the U.S., including Alaska and Hawaii , who have never had any children and are unlikely \nto have any in the future. All active ATP members who previously said in Wave 133 (fielded in \nAugust 2023) that they did not currently have any children, including any living outside their \nhousehold, and w ere either 1) 18 to 49 years old and not too or not at all likely to have children in \nthe future , or 2) 50 yea rs old or older were invited to participate in this wave.  \nThe ATP was supplemented with oversamples of adults ages 50 and older who previously reported \nthat they did not currently have any children living either inside or outside of their household. \nInitially, an oversample composed of Hispanic, non -Hispanic Black and non -Hispanic Asian KP \npanelists and further stratified by gender was drawn, and a total of 242 were  invited to participate \nan initial soft launch. Because eligibility rates for this oversample were lower than anticipated, no \nadditional cases in this sample were invited. Instead, a new oversample \u2013 consisting of adults of \nany race, ages 50 and older and with no children, stratified by education and gender \u2013 was drawn. \nKnowledgePanel respondents in the final data include both those from the initial soft  launch and \nthe second oversample.  \nBecause the group of potentially eligible adults who were sampled is broader than the target \npopulation, respondents were asked screening questions at the beginning of the survey to confirm \ntheir eligibility. Respondents were only considered eligible if th ey said they had never been a \nparent or guardian to any children, living or deceased, including any biological or adopted \nchildren. Additionally, respondents who were under 50 years old were only considered eligible if \nthey also said they were not too like ly or not at all likely to have children in the future.  \nKP respondents who screened ineligible for the main survey were asked a subset of demographic \nquestions needed for weighting purposes and are only considered to have completed screening if \nthey answered both the screening and demographic question sets.  \nQuestionnaire development and testing  \nThe questionnaire was developed by Pew Research Center in consultation with Ipsos. The web \nprogram was rigorously tested on both PC and mobile devices by the Ipsos project management \nteam and Pew Research Center researchers. The Ipsos project management te am also populated 45 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org test data that was analyzed in SPSS to ensure the logic and randomizations were working as \nintended before launching the survey.  \nIncentives  \nAll respondents were offered a post -paid incentive for their participation. ATP r espondents could \nchoose to receive the post -paid incentive in the form of a check or a gift code to Amazon.com or \ncould choose to decline the incentive. Incentive amounts ranged from $5 to $15 depending on  \nwhether the respondent belongs to a part of the population that is harder or easier to reach . \nDifferential incentive amounts were designed to increase panel survey participation among groups \nthat traditionally have low survey  response propensities.  \nIpsos operates an ongoing modest incentive program for KnowledgePanel to encourage \nparticipation and create member loyalty. The incentive program includes special raffles and \nsweepstakes with both cash rewards and other prizes to be won.  Typically, panel m embers are \nassigned no more than one survey per week. On average, panel members complete two to three \nsurveys per month with durations of 10 to 15 minutes per survey. An additional incentive is usually \nprovided for longer surveys.  \nData collection protocol  \nThe data collection field period for this survey  was April 29 to May 19, 2024 . Postcard notifications \nwere mailed to a subset of  ATP panelists  with a known residential address  on April 29 .9  \nATP i nvitations were sent out in separate launches: soft launch and full launch. Sixty  ATP  \npanelists were included in the  first soft launch , which began with an initial invitation sent on April \n29. After reviewing the first soft launch, a minor change was made to the screening question \" Have \nyou ever been a parent or guardian to any children, living or deceased, including any biological or \nadopted children? \" The original question asked about \"legal\" guardianship and included a \nreference to stepchildren. Six ty panelists were included in the second soft launch, which began \nwith an initial invitation sent on May 2. The second soft launch confirmed that the updated \nprogram was working as it should . The ATP panelists chosen for both soft launch es were known \nresponders who had completed previous ATP surveys within one day of receiving their invitation. \nAll remaining English - and Spanish -speaking  sampled ATP panelists were included in the full \nlaunch and were sent an invitation on May 3 . \n \n9 Postcard notifications are sent to 1) panelists who have been provided with a tablet to take ATP surveys, 2) panelists who we re recruited \nwithin the last two years, and 3) panelists recruited prior to the last two years who opt to continue receiving postca rd notifications. 46 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org KP invitations were sent out in separate launches: soft launch and full launch. A total of 242 KP \npanelists were included in the first soft launch, which began with an initial invitation sent on April \n29. After the first soft launch, the same wording edit was made to the parental status screening \nquestion and the sample design for KP panelists was changed (refer to the Sample Design section). \nA total of 245 panelists were included in the second soft launc h, which began with an initial \ninvitation sent on May  9. The second soft launch confirmed that the  updated  program was working \nas it should . All remaining English - and Spanish -speaking sampled KP panelists were included in \nthe full launch and were sent an invitation on May 10. \nAll panelists with an email address received an email invitation and up to three email reminders if \nthey did not respond to the survey. All ATP and KP panelists who consented to SMS messages \nreceived an SMS invitation and up to three SMS reminders.  \nInvitation and reminder dates, ATP Wave 147 \u2013 ATP sample  \n Soft launch  1 Soft launch 2  Full launch  \nInitial invitation  April 29, 2024  May 2, 2024  May 3, 2024  \nFirst reminder  May 6, 2024  May 6, 2024  May 6, 2024  \nSecond  reminder  May 9, 2024  May 9, 2024  May 9, 2024  \nFinal reminder  May 11, 2024  May 11, 2024  May 11, 2024  \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER   \n \nInvitation and reminder dates, ATP Wave 147 \u2013 KP sample  \n Soft launch  1 Soft launch 2  Full launch  \nInitial invitation  April 29, 2024  May 9, 2024  May 10, 2024  \nFirst reminder  May 12, 2024  May 12, 2024  May 12, 2024  \nSecond  reminder  May 15, 2024  May 15, 2024  May 15, 2024  \nFinal reminder  May 18, 2024  May 18, 2024  May 18, 2024  \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER   \n \nData quality checks  \nTo ensure high -quality data, the Center 's researchers performed data quality checks to identify any \nrespondents showing clear patterns of satisficing. This includes checking for whether respondents \nleft questions blank at very high rates or always selected the first or last answer presented. As a 47 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org result of this checking, three  respondent s were removed from the survey dataset prior to weighting \nand analysis.  \nWeighting  \nThis survey was  weighted in a multistep process that accounts for multiple stages of sampling and \nnonresponse that occur at different points in the survey process. First, each panelist begins with a \nbase weight that reflects their probability of selection for their initi al recruitment survey. These \nweights are then rescaled and adjusted to account for changes in the design of ATP recruitment \nsurveys from year to year. Base weights for KP respondents were provided by Ipsos.  \nBecause there are no benchmarks for the population of U.S. adults without children, weighting \nparameters were based on the full set of ATP members who were potentially eligible for inclusion \nin the sample prior to any screening. First, the base weights for  all ATP members who responded \nto the 2023 Annual Profile Survey (ATP Wave 133) were calibrated to align with the population \nbenchmarks in the accompanying table to create a full-panel weight . \nAmerican Trends Panel weighting dimensions for full -\npanel weight  \nVariable  Benchmark source  \nAge (detailed)  \nAge x Gender  \nEducation x Gender  \nEducation x Age  \nRace/Ethnicity x Education  \nBlack (alone or in combination) x Hispanic  \nBorn inside vs. outside the U.S. among \nHispanics and Asian Americans  \nYears lived in the U.S.  \nCensus region x Metropolitan status  2022 American Community Survey \n(ACS)  \nVolunteerism  2021  CPS Volunteering & Civic Life \nSupplement  \nParty affiliation x Voter registration  2022  CPS Voting and Registration \nSupplement  \nParty affiliation x Race/Ethnicity  \nFrequency of internet use  \nReligious affiliation  2023 National Public Opinion \nReference Survey  (NPORS)  \nNote: Estimates from the ACS are based on noninstitutionalized adults.

Weighting was performed separately using \nseparate targets for respondents ages 18 to 49 and those ages 50  and older.  \nRespondents ages 18  to 49 \nFor ages 18 to 49, weighting parameters were calculated based on all ATP members who said in \nWave 133 that they did not have any children and were not too likely or not at all likely to have \nchildren in the future. These parameters include age, gender, edu cation, race/ethnicity, place of \nbirth, years lived in the U.S., identification as Black (alone or in combination), census region, \nmetropolitan status, frequency of internet use, religion, party affiliation, voter registration and \nvolunteerism.  \nFor respondents in this group who completed the screening questions, including those who \nscreened ineligible, the full -panel weight was then calibrated to align with the parameters listed \nabove and trimmed at the 2nd and 9 8th percentiles  to reduce the loss in precision stemming from \nvariance in the weights. This trimming is performed separately among non -Hispanic Black, non -\nHispanic Asian, Hispanic and all other respondents.  \nRespondents ages 50 and older  \nFor ages 50 and older, weighting parameters were calculated based on all ATP members who said \nin Wave 133 that they did not have any children. These parameters include race/ethnicity by \ngender, age by gender, education by gender, age by education, race/eth nicity by education, born \ninside vs. outside the U.S. among Hispanics and Asian Americans, years lived in the U.S., \nidentification as Black (alone or in combination) by Hispanic ethnicity, census region by \nmetropolitan status, frequency of internet use, re ligion, party affiliation by race/ethnicity, and \nparty affiliation by voter registration.  \nBecause this group includes both ATP and KP respondents, base weights for respondents from \neach sample were rescaled and combined to account for the inclusion of multiple samples and \ntheir designs. The combined base weight was then calibrated to align with  the parameters listed \nabove and trimmed at the 2nd and 9 8th percentiles  to reduce the loss in precision stemming from \nvariance in the weights. This trimming is performed separately within cells defined by the cross \nclassification of gender by education.  \nAfter the weighting was performed for screener respondents from both age groups, individuals \nwho screened ineligible were removed from the data, with no further weighting adjustments. 49 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org Sampling errors and tests of statistical significance take into account the effect of weighting.  \nThe following table shows the unweighted sample sizes and the error attributable to sampling that \nwould be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey .  \nSample sizes and margins of error, ATP Wave 147 \nGroup  Unweighted  \nsample size  Plus or minus \u2026  \nAges 50+  2,542  2.4 percentage points  \nAges 18 -49 770 5.3 percentage points  \nNote: This survey includes oversamples of respondents  ages 50 and older .

It is a nationally \nrepresentative survey that focuses on the income of U.S. households and their participation in \ngovernment progra ms. The SIPP also collects extensive data on many factors of economic well -\nbeing, and it includes a comprehensive section on fertility history, which we use to identi fy \nindividuals who have ever had biological children and those who have not.  \nThe SIPP is a longitudinal survey that interviews participants multiple times over a four -year \nperiod. Each household in the SIPP is interviewed at yearly intervals over this four -year period. \nThe reference period for the interview questions is the preceding twelve -month calendar year.

of the Tech Workforce (Cyberstates) utilizes the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) to define the tech industry. The NAICS is a hierarchical system, with six-digit numbers assigned to the most specific industries. The NAICS is constructed around the concept of production and is able to reflect advances in technology, including many new service-oriented businesses. NAICS codes are revised periodically to reflect the emergence of new industry sectors or sub-sectors. Additionally, CompTIA revises its definition of technology industry periodically to best meet the needs of our audiences. Additionally, government labor market sources do occasionally enact backward revisions to the data, which may affect year-over-year comparisons, especially with percent changes. The wage data is presented as current dollars, meaning the figures are for the given year and not adjusted for inflation.NET TECH EMPLOYMENTThe tech workforce consists of two primary components. Net tech employment is a single metric that encompasses both components, making it easier to describe the tech workforce. The foundation is the set of technology occupation professionals working in technical positions, such as IT support, network engineering, software development and related roles. Many of these professionals work for technology companies (42%), but many others are employed by organizations across every industry sector or government entity in the U.S. economy (58%).The second component of the discussion consists of the business professionals employed by technology companies. These professionals play an important role in supporting the development and delivery of the technology products and services used throughout the economy. Thirty-nine percent of the net tech employment total consists of tech industry business professionals. See page 5 of this report for more details on the concept of Net Tech Employment.TECH INDUSTRY DEFINITIONThere are a number of considerations when developing a definition of the technology industry. In some cases, NAICS codes do not perfectly reflect industry dynamics. This can be especially challenging in times of rapid innovation, when new tech sectors emerge in a short period of time. More recently, the degree to which technology has become core to so many industry sectors poses new questions. For example, a technology platform designed to facilitate the online sale of goods may have traditionally been viewed as a retailer, although given the intense use of technology, an argument could be made to classify it as a technology firm.Conceptually, this report focuses on the sectors involved in making, creating, enabling, integrating, or supporting technology, whether as a product or service. At this time, the report does not include industry sectors categorized primarily as users of technology. TECH OCCUPATION DEFINITIONFor occupation-level analysis, this report utilizes the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System, which is a standard used by federal agencies to classify workers into occupational categories. See following page.WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS AND DIVERSITY INDEXThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks labor market composition across several demographic and firmographic characteristics. By race and ethnicity, the BLS segments data by seven top-level categorizations. Described here: https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/2019/home.htm. To measure overall race and ethnicity characteristics within the tech workforce, this report uses a metric called Simpson's Diversity Index. This index weights two key facets of  race and ethnicity within the workforce \u2013 richness and evenness (or think of it as depth and breadth) and reflects it in a single metric. See page 9 of this report for more details.CompTIA is responsible for all content contained in this report.

NAICS and SOCs are updated on regular cycles, but because of the pace of change in technology, government taxonomies do tend to lag the market. Additionally, the blurring of lines in technology means there are more gray areas in classification systems. See government sites for more details on NAICS and SOCs.

All active ATP members who previously said in Wave 133 (fielded in \nAugust 2023) that they did not currently have any children, including any living outside their \nhousehold, and w ere either 1) 18 to 49 years old and not too or not at all likely to have children in \nthe future , or 2) 50 yea rs old or older were invited to participate in this wave.  \nThe ATP was supplemented with oversamples of adults ages 50 and older who previously reported \nthat they did not currently have any children living either inside or outside of their household. \nInitially, an oversample composed of Hispanic, non -Hispanic Black and non -Hispanic Asian KP \npanelists and further stratified by gender was drawn, and a total of 242 were  invited to participate \nan initial soft launch. Because eligibility rates for this oversample were lower than anticipated, no \nadditional cases in this sample were invited. Instead, a new oversample \u2013 consisting of adults of \nany race, ages 50 and older and with no children, stratified by education and gender \u2013 was drawn. \nKnowledgePanel respondents in the final data include both those from the initial soft  launch and \nthe second oversample.  \nBecause the group of potentially eligible adults who were sampled is broader than the target \npopulation, respondents were asked screening questions at the beginning of the survey to confirm \ntheir eligibility. Respondents were only considered eligible if th ey said they had never been a \nparent or guardian to any children, living or deceased, including any biological or adopted \nchildren. Additionally, respondents who were under 50 years old were only considered eligible if \nthey also said they were not too like ly or not at all likely to have children in the future.  \nKP respondents who screened ineligible for the main survey were asked a subset of demographic \nquestions needed for weighting purposes and are only considered to have completed screening if \nthey answered both the screening and demographic question sets.  \nQuestionnaire development and testing  \nThe questionnaire was developed by Pew Research Center in consultation with Ipsos. The web \nprogram was rigorously tested on both PC and mobile devices by the Ipsos project management \nteam and Pew Research Center researchers. The Ipsos project management te am also populated 45 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org test data that was analyzed in SPSS to ensure the logic and randomizations were working as \nintended before launching the survey.  \nIncentives  \nAll respondents were offered a post -paid incentive for their participation. ATP r espondents could \nchoose to receive the post -paid incentive in the form of a check or a gift code to Amazon.com or \ncould choose to decline the incentive. Incentive amounts ranged from $5 to $15 depending on  \nwhether the respondent belongs to a part of the population that is harder or easier to reach . \nDifferential incentive amounts were designed to increase panel survey participation among groups \nthat traditionally have low survey  response propensities.  \nIpsos operates an ongoing modest incentive program for KnowledgePanel to encourage \nparticipation and create member loyalty. The incentive program includes special raffles and \nsweepstakes with both cash rewards and other prizes to be won.  Typically, panel m embers are \nassigned no more than one survey per week. On average, panel members complete two to three \nsurveys per month with durations of 10 to 15 minutes per survey. An additional incentive is usually \nprovided for longer surveys.  \nData collection protocol  \nThe data collection field period for this survey  was April 29 to May 19, 2024 . Postcard notifications \nwere mailed to a subset of  ATP panelists  with a known residential address  on April 29 .9  \nATP i nvitations were sent out in separate launches: soft launch and full launch. Sixty  ATP  \npanelists were included in the  first soft launch , which began with an initial invitation sent on April \n29. After reviewing the first soft launch, a minor change was made to the screening question \" Have \nyou ever been a parent or guardian to any children, living or deceased, including any biological or \nadopted children? \" The original question asked about \"legal\" guardianship and included a \nreference to stepchildren. Six ty panelists were included in the second soft launch, which began \nwith an initial invitation sent on May 2. The second soft launch confirmed that the updated \nprogram was working as it should . The ATP panelists chosen for both soft launch es were known \nresponders who had completed previous ATP surveys within one day of receiving their invitation. \nAll remaining English - and Spanish -speaking  sampled ATP panelists were included in the full \nlaunch and were sent an invitation on May 3 . \n \n9 Postcard notifications are sent to 1) panelists who have been provided with a tablet to take ATP surveys, 2) panelists who we re recruited \nwithin the last two years, and 3) panelists recruited prior to the last two years who opt to continue receiving postca rd notifications. 46 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org KP invitations were sent out in separate launches: soft launch and full launch. A total of 242 KP \npanelists were included in the first soft launch, which began with an initial invitation sent on April \n29. After the first soft launch, the same wording edit was made to the parental status screening \nquestion and the sample design for KP panelists was changed (refer to the Sample Design section). \nA total of 245 panelists were included in the second soft launc h, which began with an initial \ninvitation sent on May  9. The second soft launch confirmed that the  updated  program was working \nas it should . All remaining English - and Spanish -speaking sampled KP panelists were included in \nthe full launch and were sent an invitation on May 10. \nAll panelists with an email address received an email invitation and up to three email reminders if \nthey did not respond to the survey.

This includes checking for whether respondents \nleft questions blank at very high rates or always selected the first or last answer presented. As a 47 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org result of this checking, three  respondent s were removed from the survey dataset prior to weighting \nand analysis.  \nWeighting  \nThis survey was  weighted in a multistep process that accounts for multiple stages of sampling and \nnonresponse that occur at different points in the survey process. First, each panelist begins with a \nbase weight that reflects their probability of selection for their initi al recruitment survey. These \nweights are then rescaled and adjusted to account for changes in the design of ATP recruitment \nsurveys from year to year. Base weights for KP respondents were provided by Ipsos.  \nBecause there are no benchmarks for the population of U.S. adults without children, weighting \nparameters were based on the full set of ATP members who were potentially eligible for inclusion \nin the sample prior to any screening. First, the base weights for  all ATP members who responded \nto the 2023 Annual Profile Survey (ATP Wave 133) were calibrated to align with the population \nbenchmarks in the accompanying table to create a full-panel weight . \nAmerican Trends Panel weighting dimensions for full -\npanel weight  \nVariable  Benchmark source  \nAge (detailed)  \nAge x Gender  \nEducation x Gender  \nEducation x Age  \nRace/Ethnicity x Education  \nBlack (alone or in combination) x Hispanic  \nBorn inside vs. outside the U.S. among \nHispanics and Asian Americans  \nYears lived in the U.S.  \nCensus region x Metropolitan status  2022 American Community Survey \n(ACS)  \nVolunteerism  2021  CPS Volunteering & Civic Life \nSupplement  \nParty affiliation x Voter registration  2022  CPS Voting and Registration \nSupplement  \nParty affiliation x Race/Ethnicity  \nFrequency of internet use  \nReligious affiliation  2023 National Public Opinion \nReference Survey  (NPORS)  \nNote: Estimates from the ACS are based on noninstitutionalized adults.

Weighting was performed separately using \nseparate targets for respondents ages 18 to 49 and those ages 50  and older.  \nRespondents ages 18  to 49 \nFor ages 18 to 49, weighting parameters were calculated based on all ATP members who said in \nWave 133 that they did not have any children and were not too likely or not at all likely to have \nchildren in the future. These parameters include age, gender, edu cation, race/ethnicity, place of \nbirth, years lived in the U.S., identification as Black (alone or in combination), census region, \nmetropolitan status, frequency of internet use, religion, party affiliation, voter registration and \nvolunteerism.  \nFor respondents in this group who completed the screening questions, including those who \nscreened ineligible, the full -panel weight was then calibrated to align with the parameters listed \nabove and trimmed at the 2nd and 9 8th percentiles  to reduce the loss in precision stemming from \nvariance in the weights. This trimming is performed separately among non -Hispanic Black, non -\nHispanic Asian, Hispanic and all other respondents.  \nRespondents ages 50 and older  \nFor ages 50 and older, weighting parameters were calculated based on all ATP members who said \nin Wave 133 that they did not have any children. These parameters include race/ethnicity by \ngender, age by gender, education by gender, age by education, race/eth nicity by education, born \ninside vs. outside the U.S. among Hispanics and Asian Americans, years lived in the U.S., \nidentification as Black (alone or in combination) by Hispanic ethnicity, census region by \nmetropolitan status, frequency of internet use, re ligion, party affiliation by race/ethnicity, and \nparty affiliation by voter registration.  \nBecause this group includes both ATP and KP respondents, base weights for respondents from \neach sample were rescaled and combined to account for the inclusion of multiple samples and \ntheir designs. The combined base weight was then calibrated to align with  the parameters listed \nabove and trimmed at the 2nd and 9 8th percentiles  to reduce the loss in precision stemming from \nvariance in the weights. This trimming is performed separately within cells defined by the cross \nclassification of gender by education.  \nAfter the weighting was performed for screener respondents from both age groups, individuals \nwho screened ineligible were removed from the data, with no further weighting adjustments. 49 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org Sampling errors and tests of statistical significance take into account the effect of weighting.  \nThe following table shows the unweighted sample sizes and the error attributable to sampling that \nwould be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey .  \nSample sizes and margins of error, ATP Wave 147 \nGroup  Unweighted  \nsample size  Plus or minus \u2026  \nAges 50+  2,542  2.4 percentage points  \nAges 18 -49 770 5.3 percentage points  \nNote: This survey includes oversamples of respondents  ages 50 and older .

Wow, that's awesome.\n\n\nAlison   0:32\nYeah, that's well.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   0:34\nIf you could so you could.\nKind of like very briefly, like in a few words, kind of like your major responsibilities in this technical recruiter role.\nWhat would you say those are?\n\n\nAlison   0:47\nI basically hire folks to work in our data center strategy and sustainably in Net Zero team.\nSo my role is to ultimately I'm kind of the closer, so I chat with folks at the full loop stage and and if we get to offer then ioffer them the job and negotiate and get them to start at meta.\nSo that's the layman, probably in terms of the role, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   1:09\nI see.\nMakes sense. Makes sense.\n\n\nAlison   1:12\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   1:13\nI am following.\nOK, awesome. And then kind of zooming out a little bit in terms of, you know, Pavan really an app centred on finances and benefits.\nSo what would you say are your kind of main financial priorities at the moment?\nWhat's really top of mind for you right now?\n\n\nAlison   1:35\nYeah.\nReally, it's about probably saving for some house upgrades and also just prioritizing lifestyle as I just had a kid last year.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   1:47\nCongratulations.\n\n\nAlison   1:48\nThank you.\nYeah. So we we have the 529, but I think it's more of just thinking through our our long term plan for being a family, you know and and think about financial aspects and that and how our budget changes.\nBut I think really the specific is just saving.\nSome cash for home projects.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:09\nGotcha. Gotcha.\nAwesome. What kind of home projects are you hoping to do? If you don't me asking?\n\n\nAlison   2:13\nWe we have to get our roof.\nWell, we've gotten the roof budget done.\nSo that's gonna be done.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:17\nOK. Gotcha. My parents just went through that themselves.\n\n\nAlison   2:18\nYeah, really excited about that goal.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:22\nYeah, I remember that.\n\n\nAlison   2:22\nYeah.\nSo yeah, we got that budget done.\nReally, it's about remodeling our master bathroom.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:30\nOK.\n\n\nAlison   2:31\nTrying to make it that we don't go into debt for anything and that's important thing. And just in general.\nBut yeah, like probably in about 5 years remodeling our master bathroom.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:42\nGotcha. Nice.\nNice. OK.\nSo like you're you're budgeting it out, you're planning when it can happen.\nThat sort of thing, OK.\n\n\nAlison   2:48\nYeah, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:49\nNice, smart, smart.\nI got all things for me to keep in mind.\n\n\nAlison   2:53\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   2:56\nAnd you know of, I assume that your financial priorities have kind of changed a bit over the years. So kind of from when you first started at meta to now, how have those priorities shifted?\n\n\nAlison   3:10\nOh my God, it's so crazy.\nSo, you know, I think before meta, you know I had a 401K and I had that from previous employers had always been focused on that from when I was like 20 years old.\nLike, thank God, my dad like told me to invest a far one case.\nSo I always had the retirement fund.\nI wanna say that it was probably closer to 20-19, maybe 2020 when I started. Like really think through.\nInvesting outside of my retirement fund.\nYou know, I had met my husband, now husband at that around that time and it was thinking through like couple.\nConversations around finances and then in 2021 we were looking at buying a house and it was just kind of like, honestly, it was more just luck of the draw that I hadn't sold any meta stock that like, helped us with our down payment. And so that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   4:00\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   4:03\nWas interesting 'cause.\nThat definitely helped.\nBut then when I look back on it, I'm thinking about like taxes then and I started looking into like.\nMy RSU tags and how it's taxed as income and you know, as a recruiter I have those conversations with candidates, but I don't think it was until that time that I really kind of was deep diving into how I think about leveraging my Rs use.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   4:23\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   4:23\nThe past few years, it's been more about since we've we bought the house.\nIt it's it's funny to think back on like your timeline, but I think now it's like really it was building the emergency fund and emergency fund in line with repairing a roof.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   4:38\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   4:40\nSo it was a lot more cash heavy focus there the past year or so. And now I think priority is stacking cash, but like less more so as an emergency fund since I feel like we have a pretty solid emergency fund set up.\nLike probably about six months in cash to keep us good.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   4:59\nOh wow, that's awesome.\n\n\nAlison   5:00\nYeah, and like and that's it's been.\nIt's it's fascinating to me, 'cause. I like think back and I was not in that mindset nine years ago.\nLike it's just and Paven has definitely helped me with different areas, but yeah, so that's kind of where we're at now.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   5:07\nYeah.\n\n\nAlison   5:12\nSo I feel like we've got a pretty good like nest egg and I think now it's like being intentional around spending and thinking through like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   5:13\nMm hmm.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   5:22\nI mean, honestly, I work for meta, but like my outside of work. Like when do I get to like, retire early?\nType not like full fire movement, which I'm sure you've heard, but like just like a little bit of like time flexibility like this.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   5:31\nYep, Yep.\n\n\nAlison   5:36\nBeen with my son, so focusing more on that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   5:38\nMm hmm.\nGotcha. Gotcha. OK. Yeah, so lots.\nWhich, you know, makes sense.\nLots of devolved over the years.\nBut all very important stuff.\nI think so.\nWhen I say the term financial well-being.\nWhat does that mean to you?\nWhat does that look like for you?\n\n\nAlison   6:02\nYeah, I mean it.\nThat feels good.\nLike in first I feel like I have a good financial well-being.\nWhat I think through that is that I we never we don't have any debt outside of our mortgage and that was a really big picture for us.\nOh, paying off, my son. My husband's student loans last year was also a focus.\nSo I think you know, I think having no debt besides the mortgage is a big one.\nI think that being able to know that if something were to happen, because that's a reality for us, like we'd be able to be OK for a couple of months from a financial perspective.\nAnd I think time freedom is kind of important to me.\nAnd like I'm, I'm grateful to have the job, but I think long term being able to have enough financial stability that I could walk away for an extended period of time before finding something else. And that's like a five year six year plan.\nSo don't tell my meta managers that that's on the horizon, but yeah, but that's kind of how I think about it.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   7:03\nNo, of course your secret is safe with me.\n\n\nAlison   7:05\nYeah, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   7:06\nYep. Yep, Yep. OK. OK.\nThat's awesome. Great.\nAnd.\nYou know, how have you sort of?\nKind of gotten to this place of like feeling in really good shape when it comes to financial well-being.\n\n\nAlison   7:23\nHigh income increased and you know I was promoted and I started to you know I was getting, I got married in 2022. So you know, when I met my husband, it was like we're a very different financial experiences. And so I think like coming together early.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   7:25\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   7:39\nOn about what that looked like, combining finances like budgeting appropriately, I still don't think like we budget well, but thankfully like we have enough cash. So we can like play around with things on a monthly basis and like I feel really grateful for that.\nBut it's not something that I hold like really stringent to.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   7:56\nYep, Yep.\n\n\nAlison   7:57\nAnd so I think that's a big one in terms of like my income is definitely increased.\nI've got promoted twice and I think be really intentional about like where my paycheck goes in terms of like it goes to like 5 different accounts.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   8:12\nYeah.\n\n\nAlison   8:13\nLike three of them are savings accounts like what we call, what we call the sinking funds, right?\nLike travel, the bathroom remodel like, and I've been really intentional about that.\nI wanna say the past like.\nTwo to three years.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   8:24\nGotcha. Gotcha.\nOK.\nThat's awesome.\nAnd then kind of on the the flip side of of what paven kind of tackles being, but still kind of tied being benefits?\nI assume as a recruiter you might have a little bit of a better kind of understanding of the benefit landscape. Would you say that's accurate?\n\n\nAlison   8:44\nYeah.\nDefinitely.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   8:47\nYep, Yep.\nAnd So what are some of the, I guess, thinking about how it ties to your financial well-being as well?\nLike what are some of kind of the top meta benefits that you utilize?\nThat really help you there.\n\n\nAlison   9:01\nYeah, I mean, we used the.\nProgeny benefit to have our child. I use Cleo regularly in his first year of life.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   9:07\nOK. Yep.\n\n\nAlison   9:13\nI had a career coach with Lyra for a little bit over a year.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   9:17\nThanks.\n\n\nAlison   9:20\nI think that was like those are the main ones from a benefit perspective. I mean like the the well-being, the Wellness benefit, the $2000 that we give like that's.\nThis kind of range like I've used it for like my dog's daycare and then like I bought a kayak like now I'm using it for like my son's museum like, you know, so like, I feel like that's a good benefit. But like, it's just something that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   9:38\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   9:41\nKind of fluid, but yeah, the being able to have our son be IVF and progeny was huge.\nAnd Clio was huge in the past year of just like motherhood. So.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   9:47\nMm hmm.\nYes, right. Yeah.\nThat's awesome.\nThat's awesome.\nThat's some great benefits.\nI was actually.\nWe were doing a push the other day for it the the Lyra benefit.\nEffort I believe.\nSo I was reading more about that and I was like, oh, very nice, nice.\n\n\nAlison   10:03\nYeah, it's, it's great.\nYeah, I always thought of it as like it's therapy.\nBut then when?\nI like went because I I didn't feel like I needed therapy.\nThen this was a couple years ago. Like I didn't feel like I had childhood trauma to work through.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:12\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   10:16\nBut then I was like, OK, let me see, you know, like, we're going through this like IVF and like, trying to figure out stuff with my husband. And like, this is an interesting time.\nSo when I signed up, it was like therapy or career coaching or like life coaching. And I was like.\nLife coaching like I didn't know there was a benefit, but that's awesome.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:29\nThat, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   10:31\nLike that's kind of how I'm thinking about this.\nAnd I was with her for about a year and a half, and it was amazing. So.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:37\nAmazing, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   10:39\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:39\nYeah, that's really awesome.\nDefinitely like life coaching is something like even on my social media and everything like it's something that I'm seeing come up a lot more and I'm like, you know, there's something there.\n\n\nAlison   10:46\nYeah, people need it.\nPeople need it, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:47\nI think, yeah.\nAwesome. OK.\nGreat, so now I kinda wanna spend the rest of our time.\nKind of diving into the pavement app and your experience with it.\n\n\nAlison   10:58\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   10:59\nSo I guess to start, how long have you been using Pavan for?\n\n\nAlison   11:04\nI think they could have like a couple of like many years. Like I want to say at least six years.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   11:10\nGotcha. OK.\n\n\nAlison   11:11\nIf that makes sense, because I I think when I really started because like I'm not sure when like the fire movement for me started about, I feel like it was around 2020 or like seeing those types of things and it was like, oh, like I definitely Don.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   11:19\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   11:22\nThink I'm there, but like I'm interested in deep dive more into my finances and I think that I probably leveraged it more starting then and obviously a different goal.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   11:31\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   11:32\nSo that was interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   11:37\nSo.\nWhen you first started using Paven, what would you say?\nWere your expectations for the product and what it would, it would help you with and do for you?\n\n\nAlison   11:54\nI definitely.\nI definitely thought it was gonna be like more of a budgeting tool, and I don't think I'd ever use one.\nAnd I I remember that being really crystal clear when I jumped into it because the one thing that I did appreciate, it was the different articles that were in there and the way that they're situated is like kind of telling a story.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:08\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   12:13\nI really appreciated that and I remember just kind of like reading, like ferociously the different articles, even if I like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:16\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   12:21\nLike when I think back 2020, 2019-2020.\nI had no vision of buying a home, you know, and that wasn't even on my radar.\nAnd then it was, oh, this is interesting.\nLike there's an article around like what that might look like, or how we think about that. And so it I was pleasantly surprised by that in terms of the amount of information that was on there.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:41\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   12:42\nAnd you know, I saw the the goals that popped up and I I kinda played around with it, but I don't think that I really deep dived into that maybe until a couple years ago.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:53\nGotcha. Gotcha.\n\n\nAlison   12:54\nLike a year and a half ago.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   12:56\nSo what?\nWhat goal was it that a couple years ago that you started diving into more?\n\n\nAlison   13:01\nIt was probably the emergency fund and like buying a home.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   13:04\nGotcha. Mm hmm mm hmm.\nGotcha.\nSo.\nSo in AI, guess in that sense like it was.\nYou know, cuz we, you know, there is a budgeting tool in pavement, of course.\nBut there's also the articles as well.\nSo, like, how would you say like overall the app kind of aligns with your expectations or meets it or, you know, does something else?\n\n\nAlison   13:34\nYeah, the the last time I did want to touch on is I've talked to a coach multiple times and that is a huge benefit. Like I I'll typically start with the chat just because like I'm so busy that I'm just like, oh, I have a quick question like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   13:37\nMm hmm.\nOh, nice, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   13:47\nLet me just jump into the chat and the first time that I did that was probably about like two years ago and the guy was so nice.\nHe's like, do you wanna jump on a call?\nLike it just be more so much easier.\nAnd that was the first time I'd ever talked to a financial person.\nI don't know if they're called financial advisors, but like somebody that like had that type of mentality.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   14:01\nMm hmm.\nYes.\n\n\nAlison   14:06\nAnd I was just, you know, it was a little just kind of like, oh, my God, like, how do we have this benefit 'cause? It was the most fruitful conversation I'd ever had in terms of finances.\nAnd then.\nEarlier this year, as we were thinking about taxes, because last year was absolutely insane from an income perspective.\nAnd the stocks?\nI jumped on a call with a person and then she was amazing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   14:26\nMm H.\n\n\nAlison   14:30\nAnd then she said, you know, we could probably do this again in June. And like, you know, you're gonna like stack your 401K.\nK and like we had this plan. And so then we're meeting again in June and I was like, I don't even know this is an option like this is incredible. So.\nThat is actually probably like one of the biggest things that I love about the app is talking to folks.\nTo kinda go back to your question of how I look at the app now, it's tough for me because I think the feedback that I gave was that the goals are just out of line to what my goals are now.\nSo when I look at that, it's like the two things that are I'm like in there right now.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   14:59\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   15:03\nIt's like consider buying a home or pay off your bad debts.\nWell, I don't have I.\nI don't need either of those.\nAnd so it was just kind of like, why is that there?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   15:08\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   15:10\nLike it's not as relevant. I feel like it would be better if like.\nThere was a list of goals that you could just choose from it, and maybe that exists, but at first glance that's what I'm seeing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   15:18\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   15:20\nAnd so maybe if there was a way that I could be like already bought a home, you know, no debt or something like that to make it like a little bit more focused. That's kind of one thing that I'm looking at.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   15:30\nMm hmm.\nSo then what's like looking at kind of the slate of goals and thinking about where you are now?\nWhat are one or two goals that you would like to see added to the pavement that you could see yourself taking advantage of at this moment?\n\n\nAlison   15:55\nI don't.\nI don't know 'cause. I'm like. I'm like, looking at the life path, which I also really like 'cause. It was like a kind of like a check like box almost for me.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   15:59\nGotcha. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   16:05\nAnd that's I think where I kind of stopped because it was like starting with like hey, your age, like your path and then it's like consider buying a home.\nIt's like, well, I already did that.\nFill your emergency fund. OK, I already did that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   16:18\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   16:18\nMy retirement is like technically at risk from them, but like, I think I'm OK with what I have.\nWhen I think about it, like longevity, like maybe I could look into that but and then send your kid to college. And it's just like, well, I already have a 529, so.\nI don't know, and I think that's what, honestly, what I'm trying to figure out myself from, like a financial perspective like you know it's it's like a good problem to have and I'm grateful that I do. But I think that's a big thing for me is like, OK.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   16:41\nYeah, right.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   16:47\nWhat does this look like?\nAnd I think the other thing is the market is wild and we have to be realistic about that, so.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   16:53\nYep, Yep.\nThinking, I guess a little bit more.\nJust kind of like wishlist like in addition to what exists in the app now like.\nWhat's something that you would?\nLike either a feature that you would love to see from the app, or even more so like what would you need to sort of at this moment, increase your.\nEngagement with the app right now.\n\n\nAlison   17:30\nI think the Community aspect is something that I feel like I'm missing from an app perspective, and I maybe you've heard this, but at mehda there's a couple groups that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   17:33\nMeeting.\n\n\nAlison   17:41\nTalk about financials and like tax, we call it tax avoidance at meta like you know it's a it's a pretty bad title, but it's just it's a group that talks about financial specifics that is just kind of like how do you set yourself up for success and in.\nThat area, and it would be so interesting if, like, there was a community piece where.\nWas like people are kinda sharing ideas. Similarly are like asking questions and then being able to respond.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:04\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   18:07\nSimilarly to what we do internally in the group and it's like OK, well, that would be interesting if we could do that in the app and kind of like take it into that and then tie it back to your specific arena of like what is needed, I I.\nGuess I maybe in a it's been a while since I've actually like jumped into the app because I think it was probably about a maybe six months ago when I chatted with a lady, but then also it's just like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:27\nMm hmm.\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   18:31\nLike this isn't really giving me a lot of value because I've run all the articles and I feel like my goals are set.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:36\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   18:38\nI feel like we're in a good financial place, so it wasn't like I feel like I'd go to it anymore to learn.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:44\nMm H.\n\n\nAlison   18:44\nBecause I feel like I'm a lot more financially knowledgeable now and have haven't paid in, is definitely a piece of that. And also just like individual research.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   18:57\nSo Speaking of the community aspect, do you has paven ever come up in conversation with other metamates? Like is it something that you've ever talked about with other folks or?\n\n\nAlison   19:08\nI have absolutely pitched it like to my immediate team and nobody knew about it. And so I think that that was interesting. And so, you know, I think it was earlier this year we were talking about the tax piece and I know that there's another way of like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   19:15\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   19:23\nWe you can like schedule time like as a benefit for taxes, but the person that I talked to in the like the coach was actually really helpful and it was like a little bit less than like directness around like taxes. Like they were, they did.\nAll well, where it wasn't like they were touching other subjects, but I don't think you're allowed to. But. And then I went back to my team and I said 'cause, we were just talking about, like, how we have to pay all these taxes. And I was like you.\nGuys need to use him like it's amazing and like I would say that like 90% of my team hadn't heard about it or hadn't used it and like didn't know it existed and it was just kind of like surprising to me. And I think that's because I.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   19:57\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   20:02\nJust like.\nImmersed myself in this like financial freedom type worlds that I'm like, why wouldn't you be using that?\nMad. And so it was surprising, but I definitely think that was like the feedback that I got.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   20:09\nRight, right.\nOK. Interesting. Also like good to hear 'cause, at least from my perspective, it's kinda hard for me to tell like what exactly how it's coming up in conversation and that sort of thing.\nBut that's awesome and.\n\n\nAlison   20:24\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   20:29\nI so then come kind of coming back to the community aspect.\nLike what?\nI guess what would that kind of look like in your mind if you were kind of drawing that out? Like is it about kind of going through?\nSpecific tasks in Paven together being able to talk about it.\nIs it a sort of like pull scenario where you can see how other folks are responding to questions?\nIs it like actual groups of paven users where you can just talk to each other?\nWhat would that kind of look like for you?\n\n\nAlison   21:02\nI think it would be interesting because I think that where I see a black hole is one people just don't talk about finances, which is totally fine like you have to be like a certain person to like have these types of conversations. But I just would love to.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   21:10\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   21:16\nBe able to understand where my peers are at and like. Maybe it's not that like my direct peers, but it's like, hey, you're kind of in the same boat that I'm in.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   21:20\nMm.\n\n\nAlison   21:25\nWhat's your thought process?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   21:26\nYep, Yep.\n\n\nAlison   21:27\nAnd I've got like one to two friends that I have these types of conversations with.\nBut like.\nIt would be so interesting if I could like connect with somebody else. That's like in a similar boat. Like has a House, has a child like.\nIs working towards maybe financial freedom and like is thinking about what that might look like. And I think that the way that I'm always coming about stuff is I love to learn like I love to read and like understand and like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   21:50\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   21:52\nSo I'm just a total fly on the wall in these groups and like seeing these people talk about this crazy stuff like, you know, as a technical recruiter, I definitely get paid well.\nBut like it's different than like a software engineer at Meta.\nBut I'm. Oh, my God, that's fascinating.\nLike, wow, that situation. You know what I mean?\nSo I think that's where I'm kind of thinking about it.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   22:08\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   22:09\nIt, but I just feel like there's such an opportunity to, like, almost grow with peers knowing that you're like in a similar spot with your finances.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   22:16\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   22:21\nAnd that's a culture thing as well.\nSo I think that's kind of like where it's a little bit more difficult 'cause you have to like be open to those types of conversations which like I said, I'd like one to two friends.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   22:31\nYeah, this this community piece is definitely something that has been very, you know, interesting to us. And like we've been mulling it over for quite some time in terms in terms of like what that would look like in practice and how we'd be able to manage that. So.\nIt's nice to hear that.\nLike, that's also like something that you're looking for is like the ability to really connect with peers.\n\n\nAlison   22:49\nYeah, interesting.\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   22:53\nAlso.\nFor my next sorry, next question was So what other sort of financial products or services or like even like visiting websites or readings etc.\nLike what else is kind of in your ecosystem of tools?\nAnd then how does paven sort of fit into that landscape?\n\n\nAlison   23:21\nYeah, podcast.\nSo I listen to the buddy with Katie show and like religiously and also like read her newsletters.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   23:27\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   23:30\nAnother one is like Instagrams.\nIt's funny.\nI want to say like probably about three or four years ago, I was like, so heavily invested.\nI just like started following a lot of like money influencers and then as I started like learning and like understanding it was almost just like every was saying the same thing.\nAnd then it was like OK then like this person is just like not my vibe.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   23:52\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   23:56\nThis person is and so I think like I've been able to kind of pare it down to my name with Katie, I think has always been one for me and like her starting probably around twenty 20th and she also worked at Meta so.\nYeah. And then.\nFeeling financial freedom?\nIt was like money like Mallory, something I don't know.\nShe is a financial influencer, if that's what we're gonna call it.\nBut she also.\nHas really young kids and so she's kinda talking about the aspects of financial freedom with children and like spending within your values.\nAnd that was really interesting.\nSo I think for my social perspective, those two, the Fidelity newsletter actually sends out a lot of interesting information.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   24:38\nHmm.\n\n\nAlison   24:41\nAnd.\nNerd Wallet sends out some interesting information, except I think it's really annoying that they just like pitch credit cards.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   24:47\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   24:49\nEspecially cause like I don't like. I don't wanna have a lot of consumer debt.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   24:51\nYeah.\n\n\nAlison   24:53\nSo it's just kind of like this is just dumb, but from a research perspective it's nice, but I think those are the like main ones.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   25:00\nMm hmm. Gotcha. OK. Nice. Nice. Nice. OK, great.\nSo I guess kind of to like start kind of at least summing up that paven experience in terms of.\nLike over over the years, I guess. How?\nLike, what's kind of your cadence with going into paven?\nLike, how often have you been like logging into paven over the years? And obviously I, you know, I assume that there might be some fluctuations and changes in there as well.\n\n\nAlison   25:33\nI think I think it was when like something big was happening from a money perspective.\nSo I definitely think during tax season.\nI don't.\nI want it like I don't.\nI don't think this is the case and I'm like was it around Rs us like quarterly? I don't think so.\nI think being like taxes are a big one and then I think it was more probably like every six months, honestly now 'cause, it's just like I don't really.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   25:56\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   25:57\nI don't feel like I have a lot to go into the app to look for because I kind of like have a good sense of where I stand financially.\nSo I'm like, I don't know that I either like go and learn.\nSomething new.\nBecause that's kind of how I used in the past.\nOf like knowledge, right? So.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:13\nRight.\n\n\nAlison   26:16\nNow I'm like looking at it. And I'm like, oh, interesting. Like value based investing like finances, sustainable, like.\nBut I found out about that type of stuff actually from a podcast. That money with Katie did with like in their advisor. And so I'm like, OK, but that's not as relevant.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:26\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   26:29\nSo that's like my immediate reaction.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:32\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   26:33\nSo yeah, I definitely I think from a coaching like because I probably would be opening it to talk to a coach, it'd be around like tax season or like my husband and I kind of go through finances at the beginning of the year.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:40\nGotcha.\n\n\nAlison   26:43\nSo it's like, OK.\nLet me like check in and see if I can like bring anything more to the table based on conversations with Coach.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   26:50\nGotcha. Awesome.\nAnd but I guess when you were you when you first downloaded it, like you said about six years ago, I think and you were like starting to read out all those articles, was it more that you were going into paven and and sort of taking advantage of that?\n\n\nAlison   27:06\nYeah, yeah, totally.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:07\nThat type of content. OK, it's nice.\n\n\nAlison   27:09\nYeah, 'cause I was.\nIt was like something new and and it was. And there was always something that was like being posted that was like, oh, I didn't think about that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:12\nYeah.\n\n\nAlison   27:16\nLike, that's interesting. And like I think that's like how it has definitely differed now that I'm more financially savvy, so to speak that that's like why I don't probably use it as often as before.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:24\nMm hmm.\nAnd then So what would you say again?\nJust like kind of ranking a bit like, what would you say is the most useful piece of the pavement app for you?\n\n\nAlison   27:49\nProbably the explorer, because there's still like articles in there that I like. I'm interested in reading.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   27:52\nMm hmm.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   27:59\nBut it's not like I'm like, needing to go in there and like, learn now. But I think that's that's definitely looking at it now.\nI'm like, oh, it's interesting.\nIt's like more structured a little bit like it looks differently, but I did previously like and I don't when that updates care about like I just in real time kind of like OK.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   28:12\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   28:17\nThat's helpful because like some of those are not relevant to me, but like maybe I could learn more about side hustles even. I don't wanna have a side hustle.\nBut like you know what I mean? Like you can just be knowledgeable.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   28:26\nYeah. And then on the flip side, what would you say is the least kinda useful?\nPiece of it.\n\n\nAlison   28:34\nI don't wanna say it's the goal section 'cause. I think it's nice to have that visibility, but like I do feel like there's a way that like I could set up my goals differently and the life path I feel like just doesn't really do a lot for me.\nLike it's just, I don't know.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   28:54\nWould you say it's because it's like a lack of like ability to kind of individualize, personalized, almost what? Yeah.\n\n\nAlison   29:00\nKind of.\nYeah, I think I think so, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   29:05\nGotcha.\nOK.\nOK.\nAwesome. Really quickly, just to kind of wrap up, I was hoping to kind of go through some of the features within paven and just kind of rank on a scale of one to five like one being least valuable, 5 being most valuable, where you would rank these spec.\n\n\nAlison   29:21\nYes.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   29:29\nFeatures and as you go. Just kind of explain your reasoning out loud.\nAnd we'll go from there.\nThere. So let's start.\nWith.\nDrum roll.\nLet's start with articles.\nOn a scale of one to five, one least five most valuable, where would you put articles?\n\n\nAlison   29:51\nI'm at 5.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   29:53\nGotcha. OK.\nAnd what I guess kind of I 'cause I didn't ask you this point when you brought it up, but like what?\nReally strikes you about the articles in the way that Pavan presents the content.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   30:10\nI think it's like small pieces like it's almost like kind of a snapshot on some of them. And I kind of appreciated that.\nIt was like, hey, like this article is 3 minutes.\nLike OK, I have 3 minutes like let me just like dive into this and then it feels like it's like pretty interactive.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   30:21\nYep.\nRight.\n\n\nAlison   30:27\nI don't.\nMaybe it's the way that it's like visually.\nIt's it's not a ton of information.\nIt's not like I feel like I'm, like, reading this article that like, I'm like going through, which like I would digest that and I'd love that. But I feel like for this, it's like you just kind of scroll through.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   30:39\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   30:42\nAnd it's like seem less.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   30:44\nMm hmm. Yep, Yep. Yep for sure.\nOK. That's great to hear.\nAll right. Next let's say the the polls feature.\nSo where would you put from 1:00 to 5:00? The the polls feature?\n\n\nAlison   30:58\nThe polls feature.\nI don't think I knew that existed.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:00\nYes. Oh, the polls, OK.\nSo yeah, so I don't know. So in the.\nAs of January this year, we started sending out polls in the newsletter as well, but you can also take them in the app.\nSo I think our latest one is.\nIt should have an option to take the poll on the screen.\nLet me see if I can get to it. On my home screen, yes.\nSo if you like go to your home screen and maybe refresh it under your next steps.\nI think the first one is what's your money dial?\n\n\nAlison   31:39\nOh, OK, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:41\nYeah. And so you can take that poll.\nYeah. OK. All right.\n\n\nAlison   31:47\nThat's interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:48\nAnd we send out polls like once a month.\n\n\nAlison   31:48\nI kind of looked at that as like, oh, interesting. OK.\nYeah, I kind of looked at that of like.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:52\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   31:55\nIt was just another like goal because there's a lot more of like setup goal and I'm like well, that's not relevant.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   31:59\nMm hmm. Yep.\n\n\nAlison   32:00\nSo I I don't think I deep dived into that, but that's interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:03\nOK. OK. Nice, nice.\nDo you think that that's a feature that you would explore more if, like a topic came through or that that kind of struck a chord with you?\n\n\nAlison   32:13\nYeah, I think so, for sure, yeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:17\nAlright, let's Speaking of goals, let's go to goals now. So on from 1:00 to 5:00.\n\n\nAlison   32:21\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:22\nWhere would you put that?\n\n\nAlison   32:24\nProbably like A2.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:26\nGotcha.\nGotcha. OK. And I know we've kind of talked about that.\nJust like again, not being as relevant for you and.\nYeah, like all the boxes kind of being checked.\n\n\nAlison   32:40\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:42\nAnd let's say the the connect with a coach feature.\n\n\nAlison   32:46\nFive whole heartedly.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:48\nMm hmm.\nAwesome love hearing about the great experiences that you've had with the with the coaches.\n\n\nAlison   32:55\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   32:55\nThat makes me very happy.\n\n\nAlison   32:56\nYeah, I was.\nI was scared to jump on the phone with the first person.\nHe's like, it's so much easier to talk over the phone. If I was chatted, I was like I'm over the phone.\nI was like, Oh my God. Like, how is this a benefit for us like?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:05\nMm.\n\n\nAlison   33:07\nAnd it was amazing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:08\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   33:08\nSo I've never done the tax.\nOh, that's actually maybe some feedback, like the tax specific educator.\nThere's never any options available, so just FYI.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:15\nYep.\nGotcha.\nGotcha. Good to know. Thank you.\nAnd so with the coaching thing like, is that something that you would have kind of? Is that something you could have seen yourself trying to kind of figure out and uncover within the meta landscape without paven or was it just like paven presented it to you you were?\nLike, oh, let me jump on this.\nAnd then it's like, oh, this is really nice.\n\n\nAlison   33:46\nI remember probably Paven presenting it via like one of the benefits updates like they may have done, like a they probably. I remember this they probably did like an event and they shared and I was just like this is amazing.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   33:51\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   34:00\nI need to do this and this probably a little bit like about six years ago, so for however long.\nSo yeah, I think it would have been presented to me and then it actually took me a little bit to actually do the coach thing because I think that I there was a little bit of hesitation because I felt.\nIt wasn't set up with my finances.\nI don't wanna like bring attention to it.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:20\nYep, Yep.\n\n\nAlison   34:21\nAnd then it was like, oh wait, I feel better. Let's talk.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:24\nGotcha. OK, interesting.\nI know the feeling.\nSometimes I'm like even just with my sister.\n\n\nAlison   34:29\nYou're right.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:32\nSometimes 'cause we're kind of and I feel like opposite ends right now. And whenever I start talking, I'm like maybe I won't talk to you right now. That's great.\n\n\nAlison   34:41\nTotally.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   34:44\nOK, next.\nWhat about the the budget feature?\n\n\nAlison   34:50\nDidn't know it existed and had to find it, so I've never really used it.\nI also use a separate tool for budgeting outside of paven, so that is what is like my day-to-day, which is the copilot app.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   35:00\nHmm.\nGotcha. OK.\nYep. OK, that makes sense.\nWhat about the the Journeys feature?\n\n\nAlison   35:17\nThat I feel like, is that like the life path or which one was the journey?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   35:23\nSo journey.\n\n\nAlison   35:24\nOh, I see your personal guide.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   35:29\nLet's see.\nUmm.\nSo yeah. So the journeys, if you go on the homepage, it's like that icon in between the profile and the search.\nAnd that has a list of the journeys, yeah.\n\n\nAlison   35:43\nYeah.\nI think I've looked at it previously and then that was kind of like how I was feeling about it where it was just like, OK, this is not as relevant, but now that I'm looking at it again, it's like, OK, interesting, like caring for your family like that.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   35:54\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   35:56\nIs actually going to be interesting for me. Like, I definitely think that need to think more about like estate planning and like raising kids. So actually I'll probably.\nJump into this and like start some journeys with those that are more relevant to me.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   36:18\nAnd then lastly the newsletter.\nAre you subscribed to the to the newsletter?\n\n\nAlison   36:25\nI don't think so actually.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   36:26\nDon't think so. OK. OK, gotcha.\nIs that something that you could like, see yourself being interested in or what would you and what if so? Like, what would you like to see in a in a pivot newsletter?\n\n\nAlison   36:40\nYeah, totally.\nI think that whatever I look for in the financial newsletters is like real time.\nLike real? Not like real time information, but like the way the world turns, it is quick and like people.\nSituations can also change in different areas, so I feel like what I've really enjoyed from seeing newsletters is like updates on what's happening that matters financially.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:00\nOK.\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   37:08\nMore specific, you know what I mean.\nAnd like tariffs are the conversation right now?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:10\nYep.\n\n\nAlison   37:13\nBut like you know what I mean?\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:13\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   37:14\nLike I don't.\nI don't know that I wanna see another article on tariffs.\nBut I do not like if it's something like that that's relevant.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:18\nRight.\n\n\nAlison   37:23\nAnd maybe more specific for high earners in tech.\nLike that's interesting.\nYou know what I mean? So.\nI think that might be interesting. Just knowing that we have Haven as a benefit, but.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:36\nMm hmm.\n\n\nAlison   37:38\nJust love to read and like digest stuff, so I'd be open to whatever.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   37:42\nYeah. Awesome. Awesome.\nWell, we are kind of nearing the end of our time and I don't want to run over before we wrap up.\nDo you have any kind of last questions for me or anything you wish that I had anything you wish I had asked that I didn't get to.\n\n\nAlison   37:54\nNo, this has been great.\nNo, thank you.\nYeah. Appreciate the context and and sharing. I think it's really interesting.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:00\nSo.\n\n\nAlison   38:03\nAnd yeah, it's it's definitely helped me as a tool, so I'm excited to kind of deep dive, maybe a little regularly.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:04\nMm hmm.\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n\nAlison   38:12\nYeah.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:12\nWe you know this as you know, this kind of pavement research community is something that we started pretty recently and this is our first actually study with members of the PAVAN Research community. And so, you know, part of it is to kind of have a pool for us.\n\n\nAlison   38:18\nOh, OK.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:29\nTo pull from and talk to more regularly as we're kind of in for, you know, going down the product road map, but also we want to keep y'all in the loop as well to kind of share updates about where things.\nAre going and how insights are being kind of translated into the app.\n\n\nAlison   38:43\nI love it. Yeah, that's awesome.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:44\nYeah. Awesome. Awesome.\nWell, thank you so much for being so generous of your time.\nIt was really wonderful to meet you and talk to you, Allison.\n\n\nAlison   38:52\nYeah, you too.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:52\nThank you and have a wonderful holiday weekend.\n\n\nAlison   38:56\nYeah, you too.\nStay. Stay dry out there.\n\n\nScotty Kall(UST,US)   38:59\nThanks.

Panelists participate via self -administered web surveys. \nPanelists who do not have internet access at home are provided with a tablet and wireless internet \nconnection. Interviews are conducted in both English and Spanish. The panel is being managed by \nIpsos . \nData in this report is drawn from ATP  Wave 147, which was conducted from April 29 to May 19, \n2024 , among a sample of U.S adults  who have never had children and are unlikely to have children \nin the future. The sample was comprised of 8,826 panelists who had previously indicated that they \ndid not have children and, for those under 50 years old, had also said they were unlikely to ha ve \nchildren in the future. At the start of the survey, respondents were screened and considered \neligible for inclusion if they co nfirmed that they had never been a parent or guardian to any \nchildren, living or deceased, including biological or adopted children. To be considered eligible, \nrespondents under 50 also had to say that they were not too or not at all likely to have childre n in \nthe future. Of the 7,304 respondents who completed the screening questions, there were 3,312 who \nwere eligible and went on to complete the full survey, including 1,779  respondents from the ATP \nand an additional 1,533  from Ipsos' KnowledgePanel (KP) . The survey has a response rate of 82 % \n(AAPOR RR3).6 The cumulative response rate accounting for nonresponse to the recruitment \nsurveys and attrition is 2%. The break -off rate among panelists who logged on to the survey and \ncompleted at least one item is 1%.  \nWeighting and analysis were performed separately for respondents ages 18 to 49 and those 50 and \nolder. The margin of sampling error for the sample of 770 respondents  ages 18 to 49  is plus or \nminus 5.3 percentage points.  The margin of sampling error for the sample of 2,542 respondents \nages 50 and older is plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.  \nPanel recruitment  \nThe ATP was created in 2014 , with the first cohort of panelists invited to join the panel at the end \nof a large, national, landline and cellphone random -digit dial  survey that was conducted in both \nEnglish and Spanish. Two additional recruitments were conducted using the same method in 2015 \n \n6 The response rate is calculated as the number of eligible completes over the sum of eligible completes, breakoffs and nonresp ondents, \nwhere it is estimated that 46% of nonrespondents would have been eligible if they responded. 43 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org and 2017 , respectively. Across these three surveys, a total of 19,718  adults were invited to join the \nATP , of whom  9,942  (50%) agreed to participate.  \nIn August 2018, the ATP switched from telephone to address -based  sampling (ABS) recruitment. \nA study cover letter and a pre -incentive  are mailed  to a stratified, random sample of households \nselected from the U.S. Postal Service's Delivery Sequence File. This Postal Service file has been \nestimated to cover as much as 98% of the population, although some studies suggest that the \ncoverage could be in the low 90% range.7 Within each sampled household, the adult with the next \nbirthday is asked to participate. Other details of the ABS recruitment protocol have changed over \ntime but are available upon request.8  \nWe have recruited a national \nsample of U.S. adults to the \nATP approximately once per \nyear since 2014. In some years, \nthe recruitment has included \nadditional efforts (known as an \n\"oversample\") to boost sample \nsize with underrepresented \ngroups. For example, Hispanic \nadults, Black adults and Asian \nadults were oversampled in \n2019, 2022 and 2023, \nrespectively.  \nAcross the six address -based \nrecruitments, a total of 23,862  \nadults were invited to join the \nATP, of whom 20,917  agreed to \njoin the panel and completed an \ninitial profile survey. Of the \n30,859  individuals who have ever joined the ATP, 11,897  remained active panelists and continued \nto receive survey invitations at the time this survey was conducted.  \n \n7 AAPOR Task Force on Address -based Sampling. 2016. \"AAPOR Report: Address -based Sampling .\" \n8 Email pewsurveys@pewresearch.org .

All active ATP members who previously said in Wave 133 (fielded in \nAugust 2023) that they did not currently have any children, including any living outside their \nhousehold, and w ere either 1) 18 to 49 years old and not too or not at all likely to have children in \nthe future , or 2) 50 yea rs old or older were invited to participate in this wave.  \nThe ATP was supplemented with oversamples of adults ages 50 and older who previously reported \nthat they did not currently have any children living either inside or outside of their household. \nInitially, an oversample composed of Hispanic, non -Hispanic Black and non -Hispanic Asian KP \npanelists and further stratified by gender was drawn, and a total of 242 were  invited to participate \nan initial soft launch. Because eligibility rates for this oversample were lower than anticipated, no \nadditional cases in this sample were invited. Instead, a new oversample \u2013 consisting of adults of \nany race, ages 50 and older and with no children, stratified by education and gender \u2013 was drawn. \nKnowledgePanel respondents in the final data include both those from the initial soft  launch and \nthe second oversample.  \nBecause the group of potentially eligible adults who were sampled is broader than the target \npopulation, respondents were asked screening questions at the beginning of the survey to confirm \ntheir eligibility. Respondents were only considered eligible if th ey said they had never been a \nparent or guardian to any children, living or deceased, including any biological or adopted \nchildren. Additionally, respondents who were under 50 years old were only considered eligible if \nthey also said they were not too like ly or not at all likely to have children in the future.  \nKP respondents who screened ineligible for the main survey were asked a subset of demographic \nquestions needed for weighting purposes and are only considered to have completed screening if \nthey answered both the screening and demographic question sets.  \nQuestionnaire development and testing  \nThe questionnaire was developed by Pew Research Center in consultation with Ipsos. The web \nprogram was rigorously tested on both PC and mobile devices by the Ipsos project management \nteam and Pew Research Center researchers. The Ipsos project management te am also populated 45 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org test data that was analyzed in SPSS to ensure the logic and randomizations were working as \nintended before launching the survey.  \nIncentives  \nAll respondents were offered a post -paid incentive for their participation. ATP r espondents could \nchoose to receive the post -paid incentive in the form of a check or a gift code to Amazon.com or \ncould choose to decline the incentive. Incentive amounts ranged from $5 to $15 depending on  \nwhether the respondent belongs to a part of the population that is harder or easier to reach . \nDifferential incentive amounts were designed to increase panel survey participation among groups \nthat traditionally have low survey  response propensities.  \nIpsos operates an ongoing modest incentive program for KnowledgePanel to encourage \nparticipation and create member loyalty. The incentive program includes special raffles and \nsweepstakes with both cash rewards and other prizes to be won.  Typically, panel m embers are \nassigned no more than one survey per week. On average, panel members complete two to three \nsurveys per month with durations of 10 to 15 minutes per survey. An additional incentive is usually \nprovided for longer surveys.  \nData collection protocol  \nThe data collection field period for this survey  was April 29 to May 19, 2024 . Postcard notifications \nwere mailed to a subset of  ATP panelists  with a known residential address  on April 29 .9  \nATP i nvitations were sent out in separate launches: soft launch and full launch. Sixty  ATP  \npanelists were included in the  first soft launch , which began with an initial invitation sent on April \n29. After reviewing the first soft launch, a minor change was made to the screening question \" Have \nyou ever been a parent or guardian to any children, living or deceased, including any biological or \nadopted children? \" The original question asked about \"legal\" guardianship and included a \nreference to stepchildren. Six ty panelists were included in the second soft launch, which began \nwith an initial invitation sent on May 2. The second soft launch confirmed that the updated \nprogram was working as it should . The ATP panelists chosen for both soft launch es were known \nresponders who had completed previous ATP surveys within one day of receiving their invitation. \nAll remaining English - and Spanish -speaking  sampled ATP panelists were included in the full \nlaunch and were sent an invitation on May 3 . \n \n9 Postcard notifications are sent to 1) panelists who have been provided with a tablet to take ATP surveys, 2) panelists who we re recruited \nwithin the last two years, and 3) panelists recruited prior to the last two years who opt to continue receiving postca rd notifications. 46 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org KP invitations were sent out in separate launches: soft launch and full launch. A total of 242 KP \npanelists were included in the first soft launch, which began with an initial invitation sent on April \n29. After the first soft launch, the same wording edit was made to the parental status screening \nquestion and the sample design for KP panelists was changed (refer to the Sample Design section). \nA total of 245 panelists were included in the second soft launc h, which began with an initial \ninvitation sent on May  9. The second soft launch confirmed that the  updated  program was working \nas it should . All remaining English - and Spanish -speaking sampled KP panelists were included in \nthe full launch and were sent an invitation on May 10. \nAll panelists with an email address received an email invitation and up to three email reminders if \nthey did not respond to the survey.

This includes checking for whether respondents \nleft questions blank at very high rates or always selected the first or last answer presented. As a 47 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org result of this checking, three  respondent s were removed from the survey dataset prior to weighting \nand analysis.  \nWeighting  \nThis survey was  weighted in a multistep process that accounts for multiple stages of sampling and \nnonresponse that occur at different points in the survey process. First, each panelist begins with a \nbase weight that reflects their probability of selection for their initi al recruitment survey. These \nweights are then rescaled and adjusted to account for changes in the design of ATP recruitment \nsurveys from year to year. Base weights for KP respondents were provided by Ipsos.  \nBecause there are no benchmarks for the population of U.S. adults without children, weighting \nparameters were based on the full set of ATP members who were potentially eligible for inclusion \nin the sample prior to any screening. First, the base weights for  all ATP members who responded \nto the 2023 Annual Profile Survey (ATP Wave 133) were calibrated to align with the population \nbenchmarks in the accompanying table to create a full-panel weight . \nAmerican Trends Panel weighting dimensions for full -\npanel weight  \nVariable  Benchmark source  \nAge (detailed)  \nAge x Gender  \nEducation x Gender  \nEducation x Age  \nRace/Ethnicity x Education  \nBlack (alone or in combination) x Hispanic  \nBorn inside vs. outside the U.S. among \nHispanics and Asian Americans  \nYears lived in the U.S.  \nCensus region x Metropolitan status  2022 American Community Survey \n(ACS)  \nVolunteerism  2021  CPS Volunteering & Civic Life \nSupplement  \nParty affiliation x Voter registration  2022  CPS Voting and Registration \nSupplement  \nParty affiliation x Race/Ethnicity  \nFrequency of internet use  \nReligious affiliation  2023 National Public Opinion \nReference Survey  (NPORS)  \nNote: Estimates from the ACS are based on noninstitutionalized adults. Voter registration is \ncalculated using procedures from Hur, Achen (2013) and rescaled to include the total U.S. \nadult population.  \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER 48 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org This full -panel weight was then used to compute weighting benchmarks for the universe of adults \nwho met the criteria for being included in the sample. Weighting was performed separately using \nseparate targets for respondents ages 18 to 49 and those ages 50  and older.  \nRespondents ages 18  to 49 \nFor ages 18 to 49, weighting parameters were calculated based on all ATP members who said in \nWave 133 that they did not have any children and were not too likely or not at all likely to have \nchildren in the future. These parameters include age, gender, edu cation, race/ethnicity, place of \nbirth, years lived in the U.S., identification as Black (alone or in combination), census region, \nmetropolitan status, frequency of internet use, religion, party affiliation, voter registration and \nvolunteerism.  \nFor respondents in this group who completed the screening questions, including those who \nscreened ineligible, the full -panel weight was then calibrated to align with the parameters listed \nabove and trimmed at the 2nd and 9 8th percentiles  to reduce the loss in precision stemming from \nvariance in the weights. This trimming is performed separately among non -Hispanic Black, non -\nHispanic Asian, Hispanic and all other respondents.  \nRespondents ages 50 and older  \nFor ages 50 and older, weighting parameters were calculated based on all ATP members who said \nin Wave 133 that they did not have any children. These parameters include race/ethnicity by \ngender, age by gender, education by gender, age by education, race/eth nicity by education, born \ninside vs. outside the U.S. among Hispanics and Asian Americans, years lived in the U.S., \nidentification as Black (alone or in combination) by Hispanic ethnicity, census region by \nmetropolitan status, frequency of internet use, re ligion, party affiliation by race/ethnicity, and \nparty affiliation by voter registration.  \nBecause this group includes both ATP and KP respondents, base weights for respondents from \neach sample were rescaled and combined to account for the inclusion of multiple samples and \ntheir designs. The combined base weight was then calibrated to align with  the parameters listed \nabove and trimmed at the 2nd and 9 8th percentiles  to reduce the loss in precision stemming from \nvariance in the weights. This trimming is performed separately within cells defined by the cross \nclassification of gender by education.  \nAfter the weighting was performed for screener respondents from both age groups, individuals \nwho screened ineligible were removed from the data, with no further weighting adjustments. 49 \nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  \nwww.pew research .org Sampling errors and tests of statistical significance take into account the effect of weighting.  \nThe following table shows the unweighted sample sizes and the error attributable to sampling that \nwould be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey .  \nSample sizes and margins of error, ATP Wave 147 \nGroup  Unweighted  \nsample size  Plus or minus \u2026  \nAges 50+  2,542  2.4 percentage points  \nAges 18 -49 770 5.3 percentage points  \nNote: This survey includes oversamples of respondents  ages 50 and older .

of the Tech Workforce (Cyberstates) utilizes the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) to define the tech industry. The NAICS is a hierarchical system, with six-digit numbers assigned to the most specific industries. The NAICS is constructed around the concept of production and is able to reflect advances in technology, including many new service-oriented businesses. NAICS codes are revised periodically to reflect the emergence of new industry sectors or sub-sectors. Additionally, CompTIA revises its definition of technology industry periodically to best meet the needs of our audiences. Additionally, government labor market sources do occasionally enact backward revisions to the data, which may affect year-over-year comparisons, especially with percent changes. The wage data is presented as current dollars, meaning the figures are for the given year and not adjusted for inflation.NET TECH EMPLOYMENTThe tech workforce consists of two primary components. Net tech employment is a single metric that encompasses both components, making it easier to describe the tech workforce. The foundation is the set of technology occupation professionals working in technical positions, such as IT support, network engineering, software development and related roles. Many of these professionals work for technology companies (42%), but many others are employed by organizations across every industry sector or government entity in the U.S. economy (58%).The second component of the discussion consists of the business professionals employed by technology companies. These professionals play an important role in supporting the development and delivery of the technology products and services used throughout the economy. Thirty-nine percent of the net tech employment total consists of tech industry business professionals. See page 5 of this report for more details on the concept of Net Tech Employment.TECH INDUSTRY DEFINITIONThere are a number of considerations when developing a definition of the technology industry. In some cases, NAICS codes do not perfectly reflect industry dynamics. This can be especially challenging in times of rapid innovation, when new tech sectors emerge in a short period of time. More recently, the degree to which technology has become core to so many industry sectors poses new questions. For example, a technology platform designed to facilitate the online sale of goods may have traditionally been viewed as a retailer, although given the intense use of technology, an argument could be made to classify it as a technology firm.Conceptually, this report focuses on the sectors involved in making, creating, enabling, integrating, or supporting technology, whether as a product or service. At this time, the report does not include industry sectors categorized primarily as users of technology. TECH OCCUPATION DEFINITIONFor occupation-level analysis, this report utilizes the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System, which is a standard used by federal agencies to classify workers into occupational categories. See following page.WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS AND DIVERSITY INDEXThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks labor market composition across several demographic and firmographic characteristics. By race and ethnicity, the BLS segments data by seven top-level categorizations. Described here: https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/2019/home.htm. To measure overall race and ethnicity characteristics within the tech workforce, this report uses a metric called Simpson's Diversity Index. This index weights two key facets of  race and ethnicity within the workforce \u2013 richness and evenness (or think of it as depth and breadth) and reflects it in a single metric. See page 9 of this report for more details.CompTIA is responsible for all content contained in this report.

NAICS and SOCs are updated on regular cycles, but because of the pace of change in technology, government taxonomies do tend to lag the market. Additionally, the blurring of lines in technology means there are more gray areas in classification systems. See government sites for more details on NAICS and SOCs.

Larger companies often enjoy cost advantages \non a per -employee basis due to economies of scale. \nCustomization\nTo effectively address the diverse financial needs of employees, \ncustomization is key. A comprehensive financial wellbeing platform should \noffer customization options, catering to both short -term and long -term \nfinancial goals. Look for a program that can be tailored to the company's \nunique requirements, including custom launch processes, marketing \nmaterials, and a wide range of tools and resources suitable for all employees.\nAccount Management\nSome financial wellbeing programs provide account management services, \nwhich can range from automated solutions to dedicated account managers. \nThese professionals assist in program rollout, communication, promotions, \ninquiries, record -keeping, data reporting, and employee satisfaction \nmonitoring. The level of personalized service one opts for will impact the \noverall program cost.Inclusion of Counselors and Certified Financial Planners \nFinancial wellbeing programs offering individualized financial counseling \nand guidance tend to be higher in cost. Those incorporating certified \nfinancial planners provide even more comprehensive support. \nCounseling options may include in -person, online, or phone \nconsultations. Certified financial planners assist employees in various \nfinancial areas, such as crisis management, goal setting, savings plans, \nbudgeting, and debt management. \nSource: Enrich Confidential and Proprietary. \u00a9 2023 UST Global Inc 21 3S GTM Services RESEARCHFinancia l wellness pricing approaches(1/2)\nPer Employee Per Month (PEPM) Pricing Model\n\u2022A prevalent pricing model for financial wellness programs, particularly in the realm of digital solutions, is Per Employee Pe r Month (PEPM) pricing.\n\u2022In today's dynamic workplace landscape, employers seek financial wellness solutions that exhibit flexibility, scalability, an d inclusivity. Consequently, digital products with PEPM \npricing have emerged as front -runners in meeting these demands. PEPM pricing is characterized by its adaptability and can be str uctured.\nSeat Based PEPM Pricing\n\u2022Being a rigid form of PEPM pricing, the \norganization pays a monthly fee per user \nto provide a specific group of employees \nwith access to a financial wellness \nprogram. This approach allows for a set \nnumber of employees to participate, \ngiving the company control over its \nutilization and participant count.\n\u2022Seat-based PEPM pricing can be cost -\neffective, especially when targeting a \nspecific demographic with a particular \nprogram and having a clear estimate of \nparticipant numbers. However, it is \ntypically the priciest among PEPM \npricing models, ranging from \napproximately $6 to $20 or more per \nemployee per month , depending on the \nrange of services offered.Utilization -based PEPM pricing \n\u2022Offers both flexibility and cost -efficiency. In this model, the organization can provide access to the financial wellness progra m \nfor any number of employees and only incur charges based on actual usage.\n\u2022The specific criteria for defining \"usage\" will be determined collaboratively between the company and the financial wellness \nvendor. This may include metrics such as account activations, monthly active users, or other mutually agreed -upon \nparameters.\n\u2022The key advantage of the utilization -based PEPM model is its ability to offer unrestricted access to financial wellness \neducation and tools for employees who need them most. Pricing for this model can start as low as $0.25 PEPM and can \nscale up based on the value and scope of the solution's offerings .\nFlat-Rate PEPM Pricing\n\u2022Another common PEPM pricing structure is the \"flat -rate\" billing model. This approach determines a fixed monthly cost by \nmultiplying the size of the organization .\n\u2022In the flat -rate pricing model, the organization is charged a consistent monthly fee regardless of employee participation. \nWhile this may result in paying for unused seats, it offers operational simplicity as there's no need for continuous seat \nadjustments. \n\u2022Flat-rate PEPMs typically start at rates as low as $0.50 per employee per month and can increase depending on the \nrange of value -added services included .\nSource: Learnlux Confidential and Proprietary. \u00a9 2023 UST Global Inc 22 3S GTM Services RESEARCHFinancia l wellness pricing approaches(2/2)\nOther Financial Wellness Program Fees to Keep in Mind\nA reputable financial wellness program places transparency at the forefront regarding its associated \ncosts and fees . When evaluating such programs, it's important to be aware of various types of fees that \nmay apply.\n\u2022Firstly, there are setup or implementation fees . Typically, these are one -time charges incurred during \nthe establishment and activation of the company's account. Setup fees typically start at \napproximately $50 and can extend to over $10,000 , depending on the complexity and scope.\n\u2022Secondly, customization fees may come into play. Financial education sections may offer a standard \ncontent package, customizing or making edits to tailor the program to organization's unique \nbenefit offerings could incur an additional cost . Customization is an effective way to boost \nengagement and encourage action among employees, making it a worthwhile investment to align the \nprogram with the organization's specific needs and benefits.\n\u2022Lastly, some providers may impose account maintenance fees, late payment fees, renewal fees, or \nother miscellaneous charges . Advising Rates\n\u2022Financial wellness programs that rely primarily on Advisor expertise may adopt an hourly or fixed -\nrate pricing structure . This approach is prevalent when the program centers on the involvement of \nhuman financial advisors who offer guidance to employees.\n\u2022The cost associated with this model varies depending on the Advisor's experience and professional \ncertifications. \n\u2022Hourly rates typically range from $150 per hour and can extend up to $2,000 per employee for \nthe development of a personalized, one -time financial plan.\nSource: Learnlux Confidential and Proprietary. \u00a9 2023 UST Global Inc 23 3S GTM Services RESEARCHAssessing the effectiveness of financial \nwellness program\n1.Utilization and Engagement: The effectiveness of financial wellness programs hinges on employee \nparticipation. Utilize vendor data to monitor the number of employees who have enrolled in financial \nwellness benefits, completed tutorials, and taken proactive steps to improve their financial management.\n2.Positive Benefits and Payroll Insights: Extract valuable insights from the benefits plan data to \ngauge the financial well -being of the workforce. An increase in contributions to retirement plans or \nenrollment in health savings accounts (HSAs) may signify that the financial wellness program is assisting \nemployees in identifying opportunities to save and invest for the future. Enhanced participation in \nemployer -sponsored life, disability, and other safety net coverages can also serve as positive indicators.\n3.Reduced Financial Hardships: Examine payroll and retirement plan data for downward trends in \noutstanding 401(k) loans, instances of 401(k) hardship withdrawals, loan defaults, and the use of \nemergency or payday loans. A decrease in financial hardships may indicate progress in improving \nfinancial wellness.\n4.Impact on Absenteeism, Productivity, and Healthcare Costs: Evaluate the impact of financial \nwellness on reducing employee stress by monitoring absenteeism rates, as well as data related to \ndisability and worker's compensation claims, and health benefit claims associated with stress -related \nillnesses.\n5.Employee Feedback: The most direct method for assessing the effectiveness of financial wellness \nprogram is to solicit feedback from employees. Seek their input through surveys or gather anecdotal \ninformation from supervisors and front -line managers.\nSource: Graystone Consulting -Morgan \nStanleyThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says employers typically see a return of $3 for every $1 spent \non financial wellness programs.

"We're, we're just helping a client think through our, our clients just very interested in benefits, voluntary benefits. So, so, tell us about yourself. So, so you're, you're the global director of people?\n\n\n\nYes. So I, yeah, so I've kind of had multiple roles, you know, within just not [Ratings Company A] but in other organizations as well. But currently I'm the global director or the global head of people for enabling functions for a business called [Ratings Company A]\n\n\n\nRatings is basically, it's one of the old financial institutions. We basically rate companies like, you know, how experienced of rates are give the credit card rating, you know, like 2 67 6800, we basically give companies rating based on their, you know, ability to take on that. You know, in the financial world and like AAA, BBB plus or, you know, so our two main competitors for the industry, moody and Fitch, it is the leading ones in the, I mean rating this the best one. \n\n\n\nOk, great. And you're the global director. So, how the global hr director?\n\n\n\nSo I actually oversee about 1200 people for all of technology, data and product.\n\n\n\nYeah, so the other piece also is you know, before supporting the ratings, you know, the technology team, I was also a part of the core and you know, looking at benefits, but I'm still even now. So, so [Ratings Company A] is a 30,000 people company. We had a big merger back in 2020 with, you know, we were initially 15,000, we acquired a company which is the size of our company called IHS market. Obviously, you know, we have to rethink the way we do benefits. And in, you know, every single thing, some of it was kind of, we took it from either IHS or it changed for us or they, it changed, you know, or something's changed for them. But then I'm also the representative for, you know, any benefits changes that we are making, they need at least the divisions to be able to say, OK, you know, we are OK from a ratings perspective, we are or, you know, any decisions that we make, we, we have the ability to influence any of the benefit decisions and all of those.\n\n\n\nGotcha. Gotcha. So, so it sounds like you, you direct.\n\n\n\nalmost a third right of, of, of the company's hr policies \n\n\n\nso heavy, high, high influence from a divisional perspective.\n\n\n\nOK. Wow.\n\n\n\nAnd then when you say Global, I guess I was wondering what countries like, oh, ok.\n\n\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we have countries like India, you know, India is one, we have a lot of, em, population. India within India. We have, London, you know, you know, London and then, I mean, London is no longer in the India area but, you know, we have UK is a predominant one but we have business, you know, we operate in Poland, we operate in Paris, in Spain, in Italy, in Germany, we have a huge presence in Germany.\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah. So it's, we are spread across and then we are also in the Middle East which is, you know, ratings is also growing in Saudi. Then we are also in Dubai.\n\n\n\nSo you are basically a master of regulation, \n\n\n\nprobably not a master. We do have the regional presence, you know, I mean, I can speak a lot about America but from a policy perspective, from a non, you know, mandatory benefits perspective, I do have a, you know, because we talk about it, you know, I'm involved in the discussion anytime if there is a change that is even, they're even thinking about it. You know, I'm involved in those discussions and be, you know, we do have a say in it. Ok.\n\n\n\nAwesome, awesome. And I'm just very curious, what, what's the size of your hr team?\n\n\n\nSo I have five direct reports but you know, within ratings, it's, you know, we also have talent acquisition as a part of the rating overall for [Ratings Company A] I think the hr team would be about 300 people, 3 to 400 people. Maybe it includes, it includes benefits, it includes total compensation. It includes like hr you know, people like myself, it includes people from learning development, pay shared services, every single thing.\n\n\n\nOk. And how many people would be involved in voluntary benefits?\n\n\n\nAnd that's like  seven or 6 or seven.\n\n\n\nOf course, our CHRO kind of, you know, included because you know, she has to go to the board, but at best it's six or seven.\n\n\n\nOK. Got you, got you and, and everybody from kind of what is our benefits head and then, you know, one kind of representative from each of the divisions, but also they make sure that there is a there is a regional presence. So if I am there from North America, there will be someone else from India. So it won't be the same person. So it will be a different division person, but also kind of covering the India.\n\n\n\nGotcha.\n\n\n\nGotcha. OK.\n\n\n\nBack back to your company. Is it, it sounds like are you guys all mostly remote or liberate no hybrid? OK.\n\n\n\nGot you hybrid.\n\n\n\nSo we were remote, obviously during COVID pre COVID, we were, you know, it depended on the business rating as a business was always, you know, you can come in four days a week and, you know, you don't have to come in all five. It was always like this ever since I joined some groups used to enforce five days, but it completely, it was group dependent and there was a very small population, like 0.3% of the population who was hired remotely, we hired and, and it worked out fine. Covid hit, everybody went remote. Now we have about 3 to 4% of the company which is remote or actually even five I would say of the company which is remote but everybody else is kind of on a hybrid situation.\n\n\n\nGot you.\n\n\n\nAnd just curious, how would you describe your company culture?\n\n\n\nMm People first. OK. OK.\n\n\n\nAnd that is like, it's, it's really People First. Sometimes it's a little bit too much of a problem for hr folks to manage that. But it is a very people centric organization, very high touch people first culture.\n\n\n\nCan you say more about that? Why, why is it hard for what, what do you mean by that if you could say more about that also?\n\n\n\nWhy is it hard for hr hard for hr as in like, you know, it, it there are so many benefits that we offer as a company, there's so much that sometimes you know, in terms of vacations or leave policy in terms of this benefit that benefit. It's harder for hr to sometimes manage that a lot of expect manage expectations from managerial perspective because then they come to us. But in general, it's a very people first culture.\n\n\n\nYou know, ever since our new CHRO came in six or six years ago, it's really changed the way we have done things, what benefits that were offered or the level at at which the benefits were offered in the past have changed. In the past six years, we have had 15 iterations, no, actually 10 iterations going through 11th 1. But, you know, and every single time what happens is they, they come up, what we do is in the past six years, what we've done is, is people 1.0 people 2.0 and that, what we say is ok, this was what was there before? This is what's there now, it's like talk about the enhanced benefits, not everything that they want, but it slowly increased.\n\n\n\nI see. So it's almost like you have iterations on improving your benefits.\n\n\n\nAnd now we have the 11th version working through the 11th version. Oh, wow.\n\n\n\nWhat's what's the impetus of these, these improvements? Like why, why, what's your goal people first?\n\n\n\nAnd when I say people first, what I mean is, you know, the leadership teams are very much focused on making sure the employee population is, you know, is, is getting what they need and what they deserve. And, you know, when COVID hit, obviously, you know, whether, whether it was New York or whether it was, you know, countries like India, they were so severely impacted, you know, in a way what we realized is even we offer the bene and we offer more benefits. It's, it's, it's short, there was a, there is a premium to pay and there is a cost involved in it, but it is significantly, it has helped us in employee retention. It has, it has improved our employee engagement, you know, what we've also and we are not the, you know, we, we are a financial institution but we are not investment banks, we are not, you know, hedge funds, we don't pay, you know, if our salary is at our bonus is not 100% of our salary, you know, like in, in investment banks and in hedge funds at private equities, they pay like 100% of the salary, the way we can compete in the market is giving the employees the benefits, the flexibility and you know, the care and, and what we've noticed is it has tremendously helped.  work life balance is also one of, but, you know, work sometimes can get hectic but giving the benefits, the, you know, as the you know, compliment, you know, the benefits that we get is something that is, you know, very, very unheard of when we compare them to insurance businesses or, you know, other financial businesses, you know, because when we do comparative analysis, it's, it's like, you know, [Ratings Company A] does this. So, so we, we are way ahead of that now. I know, you know, when we compare them to some of the tech companies, we may be, I don't know, 100% but we may not be, we, we may be a part of them. But but we are not a tech company, we're not calling ourselves a, you know, we are a financial rating, you know, we're a financial institution. So for that, we are actually pretty good and it has tremendously helped us with retention engagement, employee morale and, and the, and the feeling of being, you know, the belonging, you know, it has really tremendously helped, you know, and how people feel about being at [Ratings Company A]\n\n\n\nThank you for that. I have a few questions off of that. How did you know that was a problem?\n\n\n\nIt was, well, initially when, you know, when she started, it was mainly regarding the employee engagement scores. So we have surveys that come up a lot of times when she had joined, obviously, she had done a thorough analysis on, ok, show me what the company culture is. Show me what, you know, everything that we were offering wasn't that it was just fine.\n\n\n\nBut there was very little flexibility, a lot around it. So then we would look at our, you know, then we would look at our employee survey. It would obviously complain about the money that you pay.\n\n\n\nBut at the same time, they would also say sure, you know, they pay less money, but the benefits also not that great, the standard benefits like offered in every company, you know, it. So it was so we were not standing apart from to be able to retain our good talent, especially at that time right now, I understand that the market is a little bit, you know, people are not kind of quitting jobs and stuff like that. It's a little scary out there. But, you know, when we are talking 67 years ago, it was booming, you know, and it wasn't a problem, but it was also not a stand out for us where we were able to retain our top p or people were not satisfied fully. They were not seeing why we are so different and they were not, they, it wouldn't stop them from leaving us for another company just because they're paying you 20% more.\n\n\n\nOh, I see. So you know, this from surveys. Exit Interviews.\n\n\n\nYeah. Yeah, we do, we do, we have twice a year.\n\n\n\nOK, twice a year. And then so did your new cr CHRO come in with this mandate to change that? Is that kind of why this person was hired or, or, I mean, you know, \n\n\n\nour employee engagement scores also tied to our payouts, not just that, but, you know, there are other things that are tight, but that was also one of the things but her mandate, you know, was she, she is also very progressive thinker for her.\n\n\n\nIt was, you know, it's not a huge problem but if we want to, you know, her mindset was if we want to really retain her talent, what are we doing to, to be able to get there? You know, and it was, and how are we standing apart as to why you should not go to a hedge fund or private equity which is paying you twice is what we are paying or why should you just not go to Moody's for a 15% more? Increase it? Because these are the benefits that we offer from people.\n\n\n\nI see. I see. That's cool. And it sounds like you guys are appropriately in incentivized to kind of go after retention?\n\n\n\nOk.\n\n\n\nOk. Ok.\n\n\n\nSo retention productivity, what was the other metric that you mentioned? Engagement, morale, morale. How would you rank those? Which one would be the most important to you?\n\n\n\nEmployee morale, I would say because, you know, one is you can, you can retain the people, but if they're not happy or engaged, there's no point. I mean, it's, it's, you know, it's of no point, you know, we want them to feel happy about it. Right. One is the work sure. But, you know, from a benefits perspective, you know, one is the employee engagement and, and one is the morale that ch one morale, second, one engagement, third is employee retention. Fourth one is standing apart as to why the, you know, you know, why we, why we offer what we offer. Hm.\n\n\n\nGot you, got you and, and, you know, the company genuinely believes, you know, that and, and I do too, you know, we want people to feel proud of working at [Ratings Company A].\n\n\n\nWe want people then once they come, everybody, then once they start seeing the benefits that we have, they are what we know, they're in awe like, wow. Ok. And, and it's not just the benefit that we have, we encourage people to actually use them.\n\n\n\nHm. You know, we market them in a way that, you know, we use them again from an hr perspective. That's the best we can do, right? If the, and, and what we notice is people actually use it, you know, they're use it quite a bit and they're very happy about it, you know, which, which is, and, and in the surveys, when we do surveys, we have questions about, of course, career growth and all of these things, right? But be venom, we have questions around the benefits.\n\n\n\nIt has always stood out.\n\n\n\nOh, that's awesome. It, it hasn't you know, in the past five years, you know, the scores have been like 30 40% improvement from what they were. It wasn't that we were not offering what it was, that was that what we are offering now is more enhanced.\n\n\n\nIt's, it's more than the regular standard. You know, I see.\n\n\n\nCan you give an example of what you changed?\n\n\n\nSo, I mean, I can give you an example actually, I have many, you know, and they are all personal to people and you know, but I can give you two or three if you want, but I don't know how to rank them because, you know, one is very recently they came up with cancer care now, I hope nobody gets it, you know, but there are still very few, you know, it's 30,000 people company, maybe five or six people at best. But, but those people are a part of the team, you know, it's an emotional thing. So for cancer care company, you know, over and above your medical benefits long term disability, all of that [Ratings Company A] pays for one year of your salary.\n\n\n\nOh, wow. And then once you come back, and this was a recent development, once you come back, you know, you get your job, it's, it's all, you know, fully normal and this is above your you know, this is above your long term disability, you know, [Ratings Company A]  pay one year of their salary with 100% of the bonus, you know, or if they're e equity eligible, they get the eligibility equity 100% you know, they don't. So if you're going to treatment long term, right? The other example I can give you is we started with four years ago, they started with fertility benefits. Now again, a very small population might use it. We had, you know, we use progeny, for example, we have five smart cycles. Four, yeah, we have five smart cycles, which is four full cycles of IVF starting from, you know, you know, eggs to all the way to the tr line, the egg retrieval, the full suite. Now we have unlimited. Oh, wow. So you, you just don't have five, you have unlimited, which also means they can go through donors if you know, which is again, smart cycles or something, you know, but you can get donor rights or, you know, pro me is it is they have good experience with it and you know, people who have used it now how it's a small population but it's, it's a be, it's a huge benefit. And in fact, you've seen people, you know, like the males of the company whose, you know, partners or spouses are, you know, dependent, they are using it. So, you know, it's, it's, it's from five smart cycles which to unlimited, which means they have also been able to use it for two kids, you know, I know a few instances where they use, you know, they have to go to multiple ivfs for one child just later now. They are kind of thinking about the second child now, but they're happy about being here. They're very productive. One of our top performers and those are the kind of people who are our ambassadors for the company, you know, to be able to track. This is, you know, this could not be that everybody is using it, but it is a huge benefit. We have elderly care, you know, it can take two weeks off to care for a family member, you know, but then you can obviously take FML A if it's more, but you have two weeks off. You, you know, we have six month parental leave which applies to both male and female, not just, you know, not just, you know, the person who's bearing the child. So the, I mean, these are all, initially, we only used to have 12 weeks, you know, eight weeks to 12 weeks, depending on the kind of delivery they had and, you know, for, for male members, it was, I think about six weeks or something, but now it's six months regardless who you are and that even applies for adoption.\n\n\n\nOh, wow. So if you're adopting a child, you know, and you are the legal caregiver, you know, you can go on the, on that six month penal.\n\n\n\nHm. Which is phenomenal which, which also caters to the you know, same sex couples, right?\n\n\n\nWho maybe did not you who went to adopt or even in general? Right? I mean, then through adoption and all of that and they can still take that benefit, use that parent to bond with their, their child. So, I mean, those are just a few to me.\n\n\n\nWow.\n\n\n\nThat's really, really I I those are, yeah, those are really generous.\n\n\n\nAmazing.\n\n\n\nWould you say like a couple of times you said it may be a small population who use it, but you think there's almost like a halo effect, like a benefit that not a benefit but like a positive perception and a positive association. Are you able to measure that or is it kind of just all these things together? We know that people become our ambassador. We know that there's some incredible stories that are told about people who use the benefit but are you able to measure that impact it's submit about?\n\n\n\nSo the the baby measure it obviously is through our service, right? We have benefit specific questions, but at the same time, we also have people using it, right? Because to our plans, we can see how many people are using these benefits and all of that, right? So when we see that we can now, you know, cancer is, is, you know, again, not, but it's a huge, there's a huge downstream impact where there are people in the part of the team and the the leaders of the group, right, who are seeing that person. And then when you see, OK, you know, [Ratings Company A] has done this, you actually, it's also a halo effect but somebody or the other is using some benefit or the other. You know, if their parents are, you know, they have somebody elderly or, you know, somebody a dependent who's not doing well, you know, you have that benefit for, you know, taking care of your family member or, you know, you have unlimited condolences. So if somebody passes away in your family, immediate family, you can take as much as you want actually. And, but it's, it's, it's also an honor system, right? That, you know, you should not be over using it and, you know, and, and for the most part, these are not people who actually do, people never do that. But then there is a small population who would kind of play around the STD S short term disability piece. Ok. Five days, we have to find short term disability. Let me come into the office for four days, fifth day, you know, I am.\n\n\n\nOh, I, I came in but then another two days I came in the next three days. I know we have some, a little bit of population who maybe like two or three cases, but in general it's, it's proven to be extremely beneficial.\n\n\n\nOk.\n\n\n\nAnd how often do you evaluate Sorry Grace. But how often do you evaluate what you're offering? And then if you add something, if you remove something, like what is that like?\n\n\n\nSo, so you, you, your, your team will actually remove a benefit potentially or add a new provider as often as twice a year.\n\n\n\nThat's so then we are looking at our providers and, you know, for example, that, so our progeny was, you know, you know, our contract was a little bit different. It was, it started in around July. So we usually try to change things when there was a contract coming up and you know, when we're reviewing the rates.\n\n\n\nBut evaluating planning for it because it's, it's a really huge company, there is a financial impact for anything that we do. So, you know, whenever we look at it, we are usually evaluating and collecting data twice a year with our surveys. But when it comes to changing, we, we do it at the time when there is a yeah, contract change.\n\n\n\nOk.\n\n\n\nLeif. Do you wanna ask?\n\n\n\nI mean, I had a, I was very interested when you said that you're able, you've been able to market and I imagine the success you've seen with the benefits offering is both from the choices you've made with the offering itself. But then also to like make people aware of it. Is that something that you, you find like, can you describe you, you find that you're doing it effectively, there's room for improvement or how do you, how do you consider like the marketing, \n\n\n\nyou know, there is always more room for improvement.\n\n\n\nSo the way we do it is we send out every quarter, there was a for every usually every quarter to be done. Like as I mentioned, you know, like  ten iterations give or take, I mean COVID kind of took everything in a different, you know, it stalled everything. So you know, it took like, but then we the way we marketed, we  like people 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 which is like what's changing or what's new. And then what we do is we kind of link all of the other ones, the past ones enhancements.\n\n\n\nNow a very common problem is people get too many emails.\n\n\n\nYeah, at least, you know, and a lot of times those emails get ignored. So sometimes what happens is people have to go to the benefits department or to the hr to find out. Oh, I have this benefit. So, you know, we realized that, you know, hr folks get a lot of inquiries and they don't know which means they never read the email. So what we've started doing is we started talking about it in our company town halls, every divisional president talks about it. Oh, you know, we have the people X you know, 78, whatever it is. Release came out just two minutes, one slide. This is what we're doing.\n\n\n\nAnd then when we have, you know, our C suites who are the top leadership within the divisions during the town hall, we have them kind of, you know, just speak about it once support, it doesn't hurt. So, you know, we, we have done that and it's getting better, but, you know, just sending out an email communication sometimes isn't the best because a lot of times people don't read out.\n\n\n\nSo, so again, we, we have gotten better.\n\n\n\nBut you know, we have gotten better but there's always room for more improvement by that. I mean, is we always have, you know, we can always do better, we can always communicate a bit more. But also we sometimes to find a balance between what is a lot and not a lot.\n\n\n\nSo, you know, because sometimes when it's a performance time going on, competition going on, then we have other things in the agenda. But then we still say, ok, even though we are not presenting what the exact benefits or enhancements are just kind of say, ok, you know, people 10.0 or 9.0 has been released kindly look at it.\n\n\n\nAnd the other piece that we as an organization also do when we do survey, when we send out our employee engagement survey, when we kind of measure how our benefits are comp is or you know other things. We also have a special kind of text box for our people and what we ask them is to write anything that they would like to see us do.\n\n\n\nHm. So very recently, we have been getting an increase around the LGBT Q transition enhancements.\n\n\n\nIt's, it's very expensive, you know, from a company perspective, you know, to even enroll into that. So right now, we are still kind of thinking about it, but we have gotten that is another one that's coming up.\n\n\n\nWe haven't seen any of our competitors have that benefit either because we also need to do the market analysis with our industry and what the trends are.\n\n\n\nBut I, but we do have a few tech companies who are giving that benefit.\n\n\n\nCan you speak more about that? So, so about evaluating a new benefit. So basically, it sounds like most of them come from the survey. Is that right? Or we have, yeah, \n\n\n\nmost of them comes from the survey, but we also look at the market and industry trends, right?\n\n\n\nWe, we get, you know, we, we look at, you know, one of the other benefits that the normal industries are offering and we engage with, you know, Aetna or our service providers, we kind of ask them to give us a regular report or, you know, get some insights on, you know, how are, what are the benefits that other companies are leaning towards and you know, so somebody we do look at the industry trends, it's always not what the employee wants. It's also about what the industry trends are. What is that? And, and then it's also about the need for the company, right? And, and affordability of the company.\n\n\n\nHm Can you speak more about that? How do you determine need and affordability?\n\n\n\nAffordability obviously depends, you know, what is the cost you know, increase that we will have to see.\n\n\n\nYou know, given that now when it comes to the LGBT Q, for example, right, the the the data is voluntary.\n\n\n\nSo we have, we don't have the updated data for everybody, right? When we look at certain, we can only we, we have to make a decision just purely based on just a little bit of data, but it won't be any solid insights. So it it just has to be is the company willing to spend that kind of money to offer that benefit and how much is it going to be? So it's, it's a lot of premium added to it. It's a huge premium that is that is being you know, that the company needs to pay. But then we also need to think about how much will that be used.\n\n\n\nAnd how much are the industries or our competitors? Are they offering that? And you know, it is that going to make a huge difference. But then when we look at our data, we say, OK, you know it our population right now, it may not be that right for that. So maybe we, we need to think about it or even the industry, it's not become a very and it's not the full dependencies on industry. It's also about the premium that we need to pay from a cost perspective. Will it add a lot of value? Absolutely. I mean, you know, any benefit that we have added it, you know, there is absolutely well. But then we also need to think about affordability and you know, the premiums, all of those things that you need to add on.\n\n\n\nWho makes that decision? Is it the C hr O? Is it, is it the co a being given by, you know, the companies?\n\n\n\nOk. This is what the premium is going to be. We present the case to C hr O goes to the board.\n\n\n\nSo we make a decision if we are going to offer, but we do have to build a solid case, you know, and the the idea, ok, be, you know, the group of like the steering committee of 78 people. We are saying, ok, we want this benefit to be talked with C hr O she brought into it goes to the operating committee. We, but we still need to get that if it's, it's a significant cost, it and it's a huge enhancement or something. It is, it does need to get approved from a cost perspective. It does need to get approved.\n\n\n\nWow. Ok. Is there anything that I don't know is a smaller cost that, that you guys have discretion over?\n\n\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, but, but then it's like change, for example, you know, offering like a cancel one year payment board doesn't question all of these things, but you know, going for creating an entirely new subset of, you know, also adding on the LGBT Q transition which adds a huge premium is obviously a cost that needs to be vetted by the board. But, but for the most part, it it's, it just happens within the benefits for, you know, we can just talk to the agency. We do have that discretion of course, but, but in this case, they are completely changing our benefits plan.\n\n\n\nOh, I see, I see what you're saying. Got you.\n\n\n\nSo we've talked a lot about utilization and some things are kind of low utilization yet. And yet you consider them very valuable for this halo effect. And for the rest, what are some like putting aside, let's say 41 K putting aside health insurance as what are like utilization rates that you find like successful or is it really so dependent on the type of benefit?\n\n\n\nIt is it it is very much dependent on the type of benefit it is and, and the population that can use it like what we have found is fertility benefits, huge positive rate. Now, some people may not already have had kids or all of that. But then what we've seen is, you know, our newer population who is, you know, in, in the, in the 30 in between 30 to 45 years old, you know, population, we found a huge increase in them utilizing that benefit.\n\n\n\nYou know, the other benefit is elder care pretty much, you know, at least 30% or 40% of the people have used that elder care benefit.\n\n\n\nYeah, the other benefit that we have that is not, I would say a standout benefit, but it is still a benefit. It's the balanced benefit that we offer, which is, you know, we have some reimbursements.\n\n\n\nEvery yeah and it's obviously it's country dependent right, the amounts are dependent on the country. But for, for example, in the US, we have $500 we can reimburse for anything wellness related. I can go get a spa treatment and I can get that reimbursed and or I can just go buy an office chair and I can get that reimbursed or sport shoes or some clothing, sports clothing or a watch.\n\n\n\n99% of the people use that benefit.\n\n\n\n99 like your end, it's like everybody uses it.\n\n\n\nSo that got instigated because a trend perhaps there was a trend like that out there already and you guys decided to just this, mm.\n\n\n\nMm. There wasn't a trend but, you know, there is also a lot of emphasis on health and wellness and it kind of came up from the COVID time, you know, and it was, it was more about, of course, there's, there are articles and, you know, the information out there insight that, you know, due to COVID and you know, how people have kind of suffered from health and, you know, a lot of the pre-existing conditions came up for people, right. So the company wants to just do something a little and it's, and fine at all, not that much, but, you know, for each person then I think not even 99 I think 99.3% last I check, everybody uses it.\n\n\n\nAnd, you know, that was more about focusing on wellness for employees that, you know, it's not just about the work, but we want you to even take care of yourself is another benefit that, you know, has, a huge utilization with another utilization that is exactly not like a benefit, but innovate that we also do be wellness days off.\n\n\n\nSo, you know, for example, the month we don't have a long weekend coming up.\n\n\n\nThat time we give like a Friday or something off as a wellness day for people to and, and, and it is discretionary though. So for example, if there is a team that's going to very high volume or a business that's going to, we say, you know, they can proceed and take it another day, but that is another benefit that has become very popular. So, we actually do four days in a year or? Yeah. So we do four days in a year where we actually have days kind of once every quarter, depending on, you know, the long weekend and when it's falling and, that has proven to be extremely positive.\n\n\n\nMhm.\n\n\n\nWow. On the, on the topic of wellness, have you looked into or do you have a benefit for financial wellness which could address something like financial anxiety that people have?\n\n\n\nIs that, is that part of your wellness like, \n\n\n\nso we, we have something for tuition, tuition, tuition.\n\n\n\nGotcha. Yeah. So generally the company will reimburse up to 20,000, you know, $20,000 of either if, you know, of course, you have to pass the course or whatever you're working so I can enhance what I'm doing right now or I can have the company reimburse it for a student debt that I have. So $20,000 is what we reimburse huge, you know, so many people, especially the younger, you know, early, like in, you know, early career folks have utilized that benefit. But then mid career are utilizing that for, you know, I wouldn't say it's 90% of the people utilizing it because it also depends on whether or not they you know, do enhance their, you know, do some course or you know, but we have seen a lot of people utilizing that benefit. It has also helped the leaders a lot in terms of managing, you know, and, and encouraging their teams to kind of develop themselves, which is again, another piece where its employee retention piece that, you know, it's 20,000 is not less money.\n\n\n\nW would you like stepping back from tuition?\n\n\n\nDo you think that financial anxiety or financial stress is something that your people have or suffer from? Or is it something that you'd want to address as an employer? Do you, \n\n\n\nyou know, we do want to address that as an employer for two reasons.\n\n\n\nOne is, obviously financial anxiety. The other piece is more for our people to develop themselves and gain their skills because, you know, we are going into a very different future going, you know, in, in this new, you know, A I and, you know, and, and, and I'm not saying that everybody needs to do something related to that, but it's more around, it's also a thought process that we want, we don't want people to leave us good people to leave us rather they develop themselves, they find themselves something within the organization. And it's, it's another way of, you know, keeping our good talent with us. Mhm. Yeah. And that, does that make sense?\n\n\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\n\n\nAnd, and then like financial anxiety. I'm gonna stay on that. And that's one of our particular areas of interest. Like we, what we have seen is that people with a lot of money or people with less money, they can all have financial anxiety or different forms and maybe it's, it's not actually their circumstances. Is this their mindsets or whatever it may be? But is that an issue that has bubbled up and maybe the surveys or any other way that you could learn about your employee population? Like, I don't know if there's other, the right.\n\n\n\nAnd it has, especially when, you know, employees are younger population for them. It's, it's, it's become a huge thing, you know, financial anxiety, especially with student loans.\n\n\n\nAnd then the other piece also is employees were not developing themselves in terms of gaining more skills because they couldn't afford it. Yeah. Right. And which is a part of the financial anxiety because a part of, you know, we are not able to do certain things. And that was another piece that, you know, if we are not able to get funded or getting, you know, we don't want to pursue that for education, which makes the employee themselves stagnant in, in terms of their and restricted, in terms of their skill set, which was another piece that they considered, you know, in the survey that I'm saying, you know, in the past, they used to talk, we used to always when we are trying to use the benefit, we would talk about, you know, how, you know, we would have some new questions in the survey, but we do not ask or do you want tuition to be reimbursed obviously? But we would ask about what do you think of, you know, are, do you feel like you're developing your skills within the company or, you know, and if not why and people can add stuff so that, you know, they said the affordability of, you know, is an issue. Time has been also an issue. That's why we give all these well days and all of that, the other piece that we also do with the company is then people are going through their exams. It's a financial institution. C Pac fa is something that's very highly valued. So whenever they go through C FA and C, you know, CPA, we give them three days off, prep days, we reimburse the CPA and all of that regardless, but we do give them CCC PAC fa prep days, which means they can take the time off to prepare for, you know, if you're in a technology organization going through some certification, you know, you do get three days off for pre preparations before the exams. So that's another benefit. So, you know, when, when it's a financial piece, which is, I can't afford it. The company said, yeah, you should be re use the tuition reimbursement second piece is time we are giving you that time off for you to prepare.\n\n\n\nMhm. Cool. Mhm.\n\n\n\nGrace. Do you have any other questions? I know we're getting close to the No, I do I think we have 16 minutes, right?\n\n\n\nSo yeah, I misjudged that.\n\n\n\nYou're right. I thought do you guys offer an EAP program?\n\n\n\nOk. Can I ask how you think about that?\n\n\n\nSo the eep program has always been there within the company. So this has always, even before I had started. So, you know, it's, it's any time employees are going through any kind of stress, they are, they can actually call, but very recently we actually what we did was, you know, they can call, they can kind of consult and it's, it's, it's, it's one call or something. It's not. But now what we started, we actually contracted with life works works. Yeah. There they globally, there they have, you know, in the program, if people are, they can actually even seek counseling.\n\n\n\nMm. I mean, they can go through the employee benefits and stuff. They, they obviously can, but they can also go through life works where they can actually seek counseling.\n\n\n\nAnd not just the people but their family members can also seek counseling if you know, there is some price that they're going through within the family, you know, and there are other family members who are, who may not be a part of their insurance or stuff, then you can go to a counselor through your medical benefits. But with life words, if you are you know opposing related to the employee, you can actually go seek counseling from that. So bitch and it's not just 11 you know one session they can do as many sessions as they want.\n\n\n\nDo you do?\n\n\n\nWhat's your, can I ask what your utilization rate is with the EAP? Not too much.\n\n\n\nOK, very last. But we never had a huge utilization for that even in the past, it was very little, however post COVID, it has gone up to 10%.\n\n\n\nAnd, and we actually did that with the COVID and the reason why obviously, because, you know, there was so much happening around that time and people were so distracted, their family members were distracted, it was impacting their work and it was also, it, it's an, it's an issue for the people that we have. It's our, you know, it's the people, our people and that's when he started thinking, OK, what should we be doing? Because just having a doctor's counseling for the person might help, but it may not help for the family members, you know, but it's all a closely, it's all connected to one another. So that's when, you know, when we, when we, you know, when we kind of the, the analysis, they said, OK, you know, we need something that they even employees can are and the family members can use that in the intro during a crisis or, you know, even in terms in terms of, you know, sometimes we've had some tragedies within the team, right? That time, we, we always encourage them to say, ok, please contact life for the team members are going through some stress because of this.\n\n\n\nBut you know, any the employees and the family members, everybody can reach out and they can see those conflicts.\n\n\n\nGotcha.\n\n\n\nReally just very briefly, I'm, I'm just very curious, do you see a difference in the in us patterns of benefit usage and the rest of the world?\n\n\n\nFrom a life work perspective, it's always been fairly low from a fertility standpoint, you know, in, in other, you know, in, in Europe and stuff, we don't, you know, either in the US. It's, it's predominantly in the US.\n\n\n\nWe haven't really, actually it's it from a global care lead but to the elder care, it's very consistent across everywhere, globally. Wellness is very consistent globally.\n\n\n\nSome of the benefits are, are fairly consistent globally.\n\n\n\nEep we haven't really seen a lot of usage for EAP, but as an organization, we are never, we, we don't plan on discontinuing it.\n\n\n\nOK.\n\n\n\nGotcha.\n\n\n\nI know you guys think people first, right?\n\n\n\nDo you think in terms of well being wellness, do you use those words or well, well being work, life balance.\n\n\n\nWhat, what, what do you mean by those words? Do you know, \n\n\n\nso wellness we think of it as, as or well-being, we think of it as holistic.\n\n\n\nYou know, we say well being is not just taking time off or just, you know, just having that balance between the work and your you know, person like, but well being is about taking care of your own self because, you know, eating right or, you know, taking care of your health proactively not reactively. So that's how we think about it. Even mental well being is another piece that we you know, the company focuses on a lot which, you know, when we say well being, it's not just physical, but it's also mental that, you know, if you have to take a ti take time off, we have unlimited leave policy which has, which is fine. I mean, it's nothing to go back. I mean, yeah, it's a mixed response because unlimited is only in us, not in certain states like Colorado, Boston, you know, and California, it's, it's, but in other states, we have unlimited in, in, you know, India and in India, all of these areas be, be a bound by the regulations. So we cannot have unlimited. But in generally, we, we encourage people to have mental and, and, and physical well being. So that's what we talk about when we say well being work the balances, you know, take the time off, you know, of work, you know, don't get burned out, take the leave, if you have to take the time day off, just take it right. And, and you know, the wellness is, is both and it kind of wellness and well being we kind of use it interchangeably it if there's no like specific difference in the two of us, probably classify as such.\n\n\n\nOk, thanks.\n\n\n\nI'd like to ask a cynical question and then I want to swing back to kind of employee education and leave if you have any questions, feel free to jump in.\n\n\n\nI'm just really curious if so that the, so there are trends, right? You hear reports of big tech companies cutting back on their benefits, right?\n\n\n\nAnd so I'm just curious if your leadership has had any discussions about that, what you guys think about that offering so many benefits that they're becoming so expensive and it's starting to backfire. I'm just curious if y'all are y'all have been thinking anything like that or, or not? Really?\n\n\n\nWe haven't, we haven't gotten there yet as such. But every year we do evaluate you know, once as a company culture itself, once we have given a benefit unless we specify, it's only for a limited time generally as a culturally [Ratings Company A doesn't seem to go back now. The tech company's benefit that they're kind of scaling back now. Correct me if I'm wrong is, oh, I'll pay for your drives name or we will have, you know, cab service for and I, if you don't find a subway or something or we'll pay you for lunch and, you know, you have, we never have, we, we don't have those, we just have basic coffee. You like it, you always go out and have, you know, whichever coffee you want, right?\n\n\n\nWe don't have free lunch, dinners and all of these things. We do have some c service. Ok. If an employees post 7730 yes, I mean, you know, safety first, but we don't have benefits like free lunch anywhere locally. So for us, you know, the benefits that we have are directly connected to as I, as we talk about the well being of an employee, right? When it comes to their health and, you know, mental health and physical health, but it's not about the perks like, you know, cab money or, you know, lunches and breakfast and, you know, happy hours. That's not something [Ratings Company A] offers and dry cleaning, you know, but what most tech companies that I've been hearing are cutting back unless I heard some, we don't know, I don't know something about, but those are the ones that we never offered, you know, it's, it's not even in us to, to do that. So, or you know, like a game room and everybody's pet.\n\n\n\nSure.\n\n\n\nSure. So, so you would never, I don't know, could you see yourselves maybe cutting back on, say the, the fertility treatments or, or in the future or anything like that or? No, again, if the utility is very low.\n\n\n\nSure. But just as a general rule with [Ratings Company A], again, anything can happen, you know, first, initially we had four weeks of vacation and, you know, we cut that and we went to some unlimited which which means pretty much nobody is taking time off, right? No matter how much you force them.\n\n\n\nYou know, and because, but, but the bait company does, it is in a very, very smart bank or, and the one of the example like I mentioned is this one, right?\n\n\n\nWe have once changed insurance providers because we used to have United, we have Aetna, there were some issues with that because obviously we changed it because of the premium.\n\n\n\nAnd we have a lot of complaints that they're not being covered. That doesn't mean we are not offering the benefit, but they do it in a very, in a way that it's not like they're cutting back on it.\n\n\n\nHm. That does that make sense?\n\n\n\nYeah, that totally makes sense.\n\n\n\nSorry, mind full of time here. But II I wanna go back to you mentioned that sometimes it was hard to manage man, managerial expectations on benefits.\n\n\n\nAnd, I was wondering if you could say more about that and I'm also wondering if, you know, it seems like there's so many benefits, it's really hard for employees to keep track of them. Right. They don't always know them, they're not reading their emails. What, what do you, what do you wish they did?\n\n\n\nYou know? What, what, what did you, what do you wish that? And I don't, I don't, maybe that's two separate questions. Maybe the managers are asking about something else. But \n\n\n\nso, so sometimes, you know, we offer, you know, elder care, then we offer unlimited, you know, condolence leaves and then we offer unlimited vacation, which is a big pain point.\n\n\n\nOf course, it's, it's all we have a contingency saying it's all need to be approved by the managers. But then you also have people who are over using it, especially the unlimited vacation piece. It's, there are people who are over utilizing it because now that we call it unlimited. And you know, it also a lot depends on the manager's sophistication.\n\n\n\nSo the other one of the other piece for us, when we have, we have the flexibility to take that written within, within two years.\n\n\n\nSo of course, it has to be arranged with the manager with the employee. But sometimes, you know, that is another expectation that's hard to manage between employee and manager because sometimes managers would say, ok, you know, you can take it in this, this, this, but then if the employee is not able to take it within two years somehow or the other, we say we will not, that's, that's it. We have to put a line somewhere. They will say, OK, you know, because of that, we, we lost that huge benefit and then, you know, they ask about making exceptions and certain things, we just cannot make exceptions.\n\n\n\nAnd, and that's when it becomes a little bit of the issue that, you know, managers need to.\n\n\n\nIt's, it's a sophistication and this is just a managerial.\n\n\n\nYou know, they're not able to just say no or, you know, those are, or they struggle to say, ok, you know, this employee, we are unlimited vacation. They even on 10 days off last month, now they wanna go again. They never told us, you know, all these things bundled up and then they're finding it a little hard to manage those expectations, tuition reimbursement. You know, now the tuition reimbursement has a caveat.\n\n\n\nOf course, one is your student debt if you have, you know, which is relative. So the job that you're doing, but then tuition reimbursement is not because tomorrow I want to take a cooking class and they'll say, ok, you know, that's, it has to somehow be related to your, the job that you're doing or something that, you know, or ok to, you know, you are a financial analyst you want to learn a little bit about data science. Sure, that makes sense. Or if you are a data scientist, you want to learn about something related to compliance, but you can just go up for a cooking class or a salsa do, right?\n\n\n\nSo those times managers struggle but it's also managers need to prove it. Ok? I have, they struggle with how to say no.\n\n\n\nAnd you know, on one side, we talk about benefits that, you know, we are getting. But on the other side, you're actually restricting me to not take a salsa class. You know, so again, expectation management, some of it is real logic but sometimes it's not.\n\n\n\nSo it sounds like you also need to upskill the manager to manage all of them.\n\n\n\nBut sometimes employees are also, you know, if they want to take a cooking class, they're gonna say, ok, but why are we saying that we are ready to have the people get developed? Right. So it's, it's, it's it's both days.\n\n\n\nSo there's a little bit of a misunderstanding. An overly generous understanding of some of your benefits. It sounds like some of the benefits, not at a wide scale, but sometimes it it it doesn't happen all the time.\n\n\n\nIt's it's fine view. But you know, if somebody and and even employees are, you know, they want to actually go have a salsa class, they do argue, you know why? Right. And that's how people are. But for the most part, I think it's it's been very balanced.\n\n\n\nMm OK.\n\n\n\nLeaf, leaf any questions?\n\n\n\nAs far as like some of the some of the benefits do you, you pay like just you pay for the whole benefit for the entire population or a specific population, whether they use it or not? Are there other cases where you the contract is that you pay per usage? And is that more in these unique cases, perhaps like the, the, the, the progeny or something like that like? Ok.\n\n\n\nBut in a lot of cases you pay for all the population that's eligible, whether they're using it or not. And is that, is that, is that just because that's how the vendors come to you or is it actually simpler for you like rather than have uns a surprising bills at the end because of high usage or low usage or whatever it is, you just want kind of like predictability. How would you usually we have it when everybody can use it or not use it?\n\n\n\nSo, and because for us, you know, end of the year, when we see a bill, it, you know, we have to budget everything in the beginning of the year. So for us, it has to be, everything has to be, there has to be no hidden fees or anything like that.\n\n\n\nYou know, even when, for example, when we do the progeny, we are, you know, we look at the last year trends, we look at this year trends, we know, ok, how much the usage is going to be? We kind of take another 20% on top of it. And you know, we kind of we have that deal with, with the progeny. But for example, when it comes to balance, we actually budget 100% of the people including our open reps.\n\n\n\nSo if somebody joined in December, if our product date is 30th December, they join on the 20th, they can still file for the balance reimbursement and reimburse $500.\n\n\n\nSo there, so we we actually what we do is we look at the current population and we also look at the open requisitions like how many reps we are going to be hiring before the end of the year and that's how we kind of over budget for that. So when it, when we get get the balance reimbursement, there's no surprise like, oh, we've only anticipated, you know, 100 but now we see 100 and 15 because if everything adds up. So usually it's we we try to forecast all of that forefront. I see. Ok.\n\n\n\nMm You've been so generous with your time.\n\n\n\nI just ask one more question.\n\n\n\nHuh.\n\n\n\nI'm just curious when it comes to voluntary benefits is there if you had a magic wand, what would make your life easier?\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to comes to dealing with, I mean, it sounds like you, you probably have 80 or a, a lot of these contracts, right. What would make your life easier when it comes to, dealing with these or explaining them to, to employees or perhaps, you know, maybe, you know, just, just employees kind of knowing what we offer but it's hard, you know, for, even for me to kind of keep track of every single one is hard, you know.\n\n\n\nSo for me, it will be ok. You know, the employees know they need, they need to go to benefits, call benefits, shared services and, and, and make that happen, but some or maybe our shared services are much more trained or, you know, but it's, it's humanely not possible because we come up with enhancement so much.\n\n\n\nSo I think I know was I able to answer your question? Not, not that well.\n\n\n\nNo, that helps.\n\n\n\nThat really helps.\n\n\n\nOk. It, it just sounds like you have a lot of volume.\n\n\n\nWe do, we do, I mean, it's, it's a huge company and it's so global in nature and, you know, but actually the other thing from voluntary benefits, that one thing that we have quite fast is childcare, hm could give childcare benefits. However, we have not, we we may not be considering that at least, at least not in the next two years. We have got quite a few requests. But in lieu of what we say is ok, you know, work with your manager and you know, instead of coming to the office on Tuesday and come on Wednesday or you know, we do that accommodation and flexibility, but, but we do have childcare in India.\n\n\n\nHowever, we don't have it because of the cost and how diversified our population is now. You know, it, it it it's a little harder for us to have childcare. So that is another thing that we have not really thought about. The other one. Also, initially when past PRE COVID, we used to also get request about transportation. So we live in the city.\n\n\n\nYou know, no, so I mean the offices in the city but people don't mostly live in the city, they live in New Jersey or Connecticut huge commute. So they often talk about maybe like a bus or something. But it's so, but it's so hard because of the timing, you know, how many ships do they have? How many people? Right? And how many are going to board the bus for us? It it wasn't, we thought about it. It wasn't a very viable arrangement for us. So we did not we are not going to pursue that something in case anything else.\n\n\n\nNo, I extremely thankful this is very helpful.\n\n\n\nI hope I was able to answer all the questions. But if you think of something, you send me an email or something we appreciate that.\n\n\n\nIt's fairly casual. Just send me an email if you have any follow up. You know, I'm very can go that way and then happy to answer it.\n\n\n\nOk, we really appreciate that. And you, I'm just assuming that this information is only used for the research purposes.\n\n\n\nThis is internal.\n\n\n\nWe're not sharing it outside at all.\n\n\n\nand we will, not give, we, we're gonna anonymize your name.\n\n\n\nSo huh.\n\n\n\nEvery like organization everything is going to be anonymous.\n\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n\nYeah, we, we would mean we would never use this in any marketing or anything like that in the US or something.\n\n\n\nI mean, I can, I mean, you could even give me the name while they call like I can call you Alice.\n\n\n\nM you know what I mean? Alice, M at financial services company X says this so that's basically you won't give the financial company name or anything. I can, we can leave it out. We will leave it out.\n\n\n\nYeah, I would like that.\n\n\n\nWe will do that. I, I can do that for you. Yes.\n\n\n\nYou know, just the financial because we are a huge financial institution. So you can say that but I will probably make up a name for your company.\n\n\n\nSo we'll, we'll leave it up and my name, company name, all of the things you're I'm probably gonna call you am. So, so like a bad name.\n\n\n\nVia.\n\n\n\nThank you so much. You totally make me want to work at [Ratings Company A] frankly.\n\n\n\nAnd it sounds like you guys are really killing it over there.

EXPRESSING MY AUTHENTIC SELF VS \nFINDING BELONGING IN FACEBOOK \nCULTURE\nFacebook's mission focuses on building\ncommunity, which isemphasized both in\nFacebook product andculture .Authenticity and\nbelonging aretheroots ofcommunity building\nand apre-requisite for getting people to\nconsume (learn and seek guidance) and\ncontribute (share) meaningfully .\n2.MEANINGFUL VSMEASURABLE\nFacebook's quantitative culture around\nmeasurement canconflict with what employees\nfind meaningful \u2013both personally and in\nrelation to the business .Employees\npassionately strive tocreate impact but feel\nrestricted bythe need tofocus on the\nquantifiable .3.SPEAKING UP TO SEEK GUIDANCE VS\nSIGNALING STRENGTH\nWhile thismay contradict Facebook's \"fail fast\"\nmindset, when itcomes tofinances, employees\nstill feel the need toappear confident about\nmoney even when they're not, even when\nencouraged toproactively seek help.\n4.FEELING GRATEFUL VSASSERTING MY\nVALUE\nOutside of the tech industry, the high\ncompensation and generous benefits at\nFacebook areperceived differently than when\nsomeone isinside theindustry .Employees want\ntoretain thesense ofgratitude they feelbefore\nthey entered theindustry, butthey also want to\nensure they are being rewarded on-par with\ntheir FBandindustry colleagues .5.CARING FOR MY LOVED ONES VS\nSECURING MYFUTURE\nEchoing the inside versus outside tech industry \nperception, Facebook employees both want to \nand feel the pressure to financially provide for \ntheir family, friends, and larger community and \nfear that expressing concern over their financial \nstate would be negatively perceived.\n6. PURSING MY PASSIONS VS COVERING \nMY BASES\nThis dilemma stems from Facebook's \"ruthless \nprioritization\" principle of pursuing the most \ninfluential idea first. Employees are applying this \nwork principle to their personal life, and as a \nresult, not focusing on their financial well -being.Check! | Confidential and proprietary \u00a9 2019 Round Feather, Inc. 65FinWell | Journey@ Facebook\nA VISION FOR REFRAMING AND SCALING CARE\nTaking a bird's eye view, we see how these e motional \ndilemmas come together to create tension along two \ncore axes \u2013who I am and how I act. Opportunity lies in \nresolving this toredefine the idea of \"care\" that is \nscalable. | Confidential and proprietary \u00a9 2019 Round Feather, Inc. 66FinWell | Journey@ Facebook\nA VISION FOR REFRAMING AND SCALING CARE\nThe tensions at play when embracing their identity and then taking action\nThe struggle between Authenticity and Belonging\nFor Facebook employees, there is a core tension between expressing who they are and \nconnecting to the larger Facebook community. This is a struggle between authenticity and \nbelonging. The paradox here is that without authenticity, there is no true belonging.The struggle between Agency and Guidance\nThis bleeds into how I act at work. Because when my authenticity is limited, I struggle \nto express my agency, the ability to trust myself and chart my own course. On the \nother hand, without a sense of belonging, I struggle to take guidance from others.\nCheck! | Confidential and proprietary \u00a9 2019 Round Feather, Inc. 67FinWell | Journey@ Facebook\nA VISION FOR REFRAMING AND SCALING CARE\nCreating emotional safety by resolving core tensions\nCreating emotional safety at the workplace\nWhen these tensions are resolved, employees feel \nemotionally safe at work \u2013safe to ask their questions, \nto express who they are, and to make decisions for \nthemselves.\nHumanizing communication around care\nThis framework doesn't just explain dynamics, however. \nWhen communicating the value of Facebook benefits, \nit's important to reframe how Life@ cares for its \nemployees not just on a functional level but on a \nhuman level.\nIntangible values of benefits\nLife@ has the opportunity to communicate its offerings \nin terms of supporting who employees are, in allowing \nthem to show up to work authentically, and in creating \na culture of belonging.

This gap can be effectively bridged by addressing emotional \nand behavioral barriers that get in the way at each step in the employee \nengagement.\nFinancial well -being needs to be approached through a broader lens \nthrough empathy and connectivity\nSolving for financial well -being calls for a nuanced, holistic approach, that puts \nemployees' feelings ahead of features and creates connectivity across the entire \nemployee experience.\nCare can be redefined to be more meaningful but also scalable\nThere is an opportunity to create a win -win situation by meaningfully reframing \ncare in such a way that it goes beyond supporting employees and empowers \nthem to act with a sense of agency. This shift, from playing the role of a guide \nwho supports, to a coach who fosters agency is a sustainable approach to \ncaring, given the context of scaling.Resilience is built by addressing human needs in phases, applying to both \nfinances and life\nThe journey of building resilience begins with the first step: the need for security and \nacknowledgement through validation both at work, and of their financial situation. \nThe second step is competence and order, equipping them to fully understand and \ntake control. The third step then progresses into purpose and impact: contributing \nwith a sense of purpose and being able to create impact.\nOne size won't fit: The solve calls for balancing high -\ntouch with high -tech by bringing in relevance , \nrelatability and actionability through an experience that \nmeets employees where they are (receptivity \nmoments), acknowledges where they are coming from\n(behavioural mindsets) and empowers them to get to \nwhere they want to be (fostering agency).FinWell | Journey@ Facebook | Confidential and proprietary \u00a9 2019 Round Feather, Inc. 128FinWell | Journey@ Facebook\nMeet me where I am atOVERARCHING PRINCIPLE FOR \nDESIGNING AROUND PEOPLE\nKnow where I am coming from | Confidential and proprietary \u00a9 2019 Round Feather, Inc. 129FinWell | Journey@ Facebook\nBUILDING THE SOLVE\nThe key ingredients:SEGMENTATION FRAMEWORK\nDevising a skeleton for prioritizing the MVP journeys\nLow\nincome \nbackgroundWoman \nin tech\nActively\nreligiousLatinaPaying off\nmy credit \ncard debtCaring for \nparents\nGetting \nmarriedBuying a \nhouseGuide me through financial rabbit holesMake me feel less dumb\nAlleviate my fear of the unknown\nBreak my procrastination during uncertainty\nReduce my shame of not fitting inTake out the work needed to learnDeconstruct the pain and shame of debtReduce my \"figure it out\" fatigueWHERE I'M COMING FROM WHERE I'M ATFB MILESTONE:     New at Facebook \u2022    1stanniversary at Facebook    \u2022    Becoming a manager    \u2022    Four -year point at Facebook    \u2022    FB veteran (10+ years)\nHELP ME GET THERE\nWoman in tech \u2022 New to US \u2022 Latina \u2022 Black \n\u2022Low -income background \u2022 First gen \ncollege student \u2022 Actively religious \u2022 Child \nof immigrants \u2022 New to tech \u2022 Veteran \u2022 \nLGBTQ Getting married \u2022 Divorced \u2022 Having a child \n\u2022 Paying off debt \u2022 Buying a home \u2022 Loss \nof a parent \u2022 Loss of a spouse \u2022 Becoming a \ncaregiver \u2022 First job \u2022 Sending kids to \ncollege \u2022 Thinking about retirement(life moments / functional priorities) (background influencers) (tangible actions)||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\nPAY -OFFS(financial well -being maturity)\nEffectively manage spurts in \nin-flow of (financial) resources\nHone my ability to balance widening \nrange of priorities as my goals and \ncircle of care evolve\nEffortlessly monitor and ensure \nthat I'm staying on course \nCraft my own legacyDevelop proficiency around my \nnew financial landscape (new to US)Empower me to\u2026\n10+ variables . 10+ variables .balancing \nconflicting \nprioritiesCheck! | Confidential and proprietary \u00a9 2019 Round Feather, Inc. 130FinWell | Journey@ Facebook\nBUILDING THE SOLVE\nThe key ingredients:\nIntegrated / single -window\n(vs. siloed offerings)\nSeamless integration of \nhi-tech & hi -touch\nBUILDING THE SOLVE\nScaling \"care\" with speed and agility | Confidential and proprietary \u00a9 2019 Round Feather, Inc. 131FinWell | Journey@ Facebook\n`\nScope \u2013Approach for down -streaming insights towards strategy and solutionsInputs on solution scope, \nbusiness/vertical priorities, \nengagement environmentRF Insights & \nConcepts\nInputs from FB / \nLife@ TeamInsights, design principles\nand concept experience\nTechnology \nAssessment\nAlign towards\nTranslationIT environment + \nAI capabilitiesFinancial vs. Overall well -being\nResolve touchpoints between high-\ntech and high -touchFinalize content \nstrategy against\nexperience flowArt-of-the-possible\ndesign of the integrated experience \n(high -tech meets high -touch)\nState -of-the-Feasible\nMVP\nMVP targeting financial \nwell-being / overall benefits\nIterate with\ntest users\nCommunication Packets\n+ Playbook for high -touch\nDeveloping \nContent\nScoping the \nMVP\nDesigning the \nExperience\nContent -building for relevance and \nrelatability, human -centric playbook \nfor high -touch engagementsBUILDING THE SOLVE\nRoadmap for translating from concept to MVPUPDATE THIS SECTION \nWITH LATEST VERSIONS | Confidential and proprietary \u00a9 2019 Round Feather, Inc. 132FinWell | Journey@ Facebook\nBroader engagement with \nBusiness functions\nWe are here\nDesign, Test, and Iterate the MVP\nJuly 2019 Jan 2020\nDigital LaunchBUILDING THE SOLVE\nSetting milestones for building a financial resilience solution | Confidential and proprietary \u00a9 2019 Round Feather, Inc. 133FinWell | Journey@ Facebook\n10.

State of the Tech Workforce quantifies the size and scope of the tech industry and the tech workforce across multiple vectors. To provide additional context, the report includes time-series trending, average wages, business establishments, job postings, gender ratios, innovation and emerging tech metrics, and more. For the interactive online version, please visit www.cyberstates.org. As with any sector-level report, there are varying interpretations of what constitutes the tech sector and the tech workforce. Some of this variance may be attributed to the objectives of the author. Is the goal to depict the broadest possible representation of STEM and digital economy fields, or a more narrowly defined technology subset? Is the goal to capture all possible knowledge workers, or a more narrowly defined technology subset? CompTIA weighs a number of factors in making these decisions. See the methodology section for details of the specific NAICS codes and SOC codes CompTIA uses in its definitions.IMPORTANT NOTE about timing: the 2022 estimates and 2023 projections represent the most up-to-date data at the time of reporting.

The foundation is the set of technology professionals working in technical positions, such as IT support, network engineering, software development, data science, and related roles. Many of these professionals work for technology companies (42%), but many others are employed by organizations across every industry sector in the U.S. economy (58%).The second component consists of the business professionals employed by technology companies. These professionals \u2013 encompassing  sales, marketing, finance, HR, operations and management, play an important role in supporting the development and delivery of the technology products and services used throughout the economy. Approximately 39% of the net tech-employment total consists of tech industry business professionals. One final segment involves workers classified as self-employed. For the purposes of this report, only dedicated, full-time self-employed technology workers are counted towards net tech employment. Workers that are characterized as \"gig\" workers, which may entail working on the side for supplementary income, are excluded from this analysis due to several uncertainties with the data and to minimize the possibility of double counting.N = Technology professionals employed across the economy, including in the tech sector (e.g. software developers, network architects, database admins, etc.)  N = Tech sector employment, less technology professionals(e.g. sales, marketing, finance, HR, etc.)\n= 100,000 workers9.4 millionProjected total workers in 202361%% of NET tech employment is in technology occupations\nSource: Lightcast | U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | CompTIA Copyright \u00a9 2023 CompTIA | CompTIA.org | Cyberstates.org | State of the Tech Workforce | Page 65.06.58.09.5\n201720182019202020212022est.2023proj.+272,323+3.0%\n0.02.04.06.0\n201720182019202020212022est.2023proj.YEAR IN REVIEWNET TECH EMPLOYMENT TRENDING\nTECH INDUSTRY EMPLOYMENT TRENDINGKEY POINTS\u21e5The 2022 estimates and 2023 projections are presented with the most up-to-date data at the time of reporting. As with any labor market data source there is a lag effect and recent developments during late 2022 and early 2023 will likely not be fully reflected in the data. \u21e5Net tech employment in the United States \u2013 as described on the previous page, reached an estimated 9,156,390 workers in 2022, an increase of 3.2% year-over-year or approximately 286,400 additional workers employed in technology. \u21e5Employment in the tech sector has grown since the pandemic and could reach its projected target of 9,428,713, in 2023 which translates to 272,323 net new workers added or +3.0% growth. \u21e5The tech sector and the broader base of technology workers employed across the economy experienced several bumps during the pandemic, but generally held up well. In some cases, demand for technology services and infrastructure to support new remote work models, ecommerce, or revamped supply chains exploded, stretching the capacity of solution providers and MSPs.\u21e5Among the components of net tech employment, the tech sector side of the equation is projected to grow 3.2% in the year ahead, with the occupation side across the economy is projected to grow at 3.4%. \u21e5Within the technology industry category, which encompasses technology occupations and supporting business occupations, growth has varied. Since 2017, the IT services and custom software services category powered job growth, accounting for 52% of job gains. Software [product] accounted for 29% of the job gains in the same time period. Tech manufacturing saw a fall in number of jobs created in 2020 and 2021 but is forecasted to grow at 1.2% in 2023. \u21e5Within the tech occupation category, software, programmers, web and QA related occupations accounted for 59.5% of new jobs created between 2017 and 2022. \u21e5Top projected growth occupations for 2023:5.5% Data Scientists and Data Analysts5.2% Cybersecurity Analysts and Engineers4.7% Web Designers and UI/UX4.7% Software Developers and Engineers4.1% Software QA and Testers3.4% CIOs and IT Directors2.6% Systems Analysts and Engineers2.4% IT Support Specialists\u21e5Economic impact data further corroborates the importance of the tech sector.

The macro trend of digital transformation means demand for tech talent across the full spectrum of tech job roles will continue unabated.   \u21e5Calculating future workforce needs over the next decade is a function of several variables. There is a growth component, which may entail organizations adding headcount due to expansion or possibly to support new emerging technologies. There is a retirement factor, with a portion of the workforce transitioning away from the labor market permanently. And lastly, there is a segment leaving the workforce for some other reason, also referred to as separations. These may stem from a career change, layoffs, a return to school, family pursuits, or other. Changes to any of these variables will affect future workforce projections.\u21e5The replacement rate for tech occupations during the 2023-2033 period is expected to average about 7% annually, or approximately 400,000 workers each year, totaling several million through 2033. The total turnover rate, which encompasses workers transitioning within tech such as those promoted into a new role, is estimated to average 36% annually during the period. In comparison, the highest turnover occupations have annual rates typically in the 100%-200% range.\u21e5Tech occupation employment over the next 10 years is expected to grow at about twice the rate of overall employment across the economy. Projected tech growth rates above the national rate:\n\u21e5Job posting data provides another layer of insight into the tech job market outlook. Because government labor taxonomies \u2013 Standard Occupation Codes (SOCs), lag the speed with which the market changes, job posting data provides a more up-to-date look at the skills and experiences employers seek.\u21e5Overall tech job postings among U.S. employers dipped during 2020 due to the pandemic hiring slowdown and then rebounded through 2022 and into 2023. Note: job postings should not be interpreted as unfilled jobs and there is not a 1:1 relationship between postings and actual hires made.TECH OCCUPATION EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOKWorkforce need = annual replacement rate + growth rate\nEMERGING TECH DEMAND RAMPS UP+186% Growth in emerging tech job postingsAnnual emerging tech job postings by U.S. employersMILLIONS OF WORKERSAGGREGATE ANNUAL POSTINGS FOR TECH JOB ROLES\n01,000,0002,000,0003,000,0004,000,00020122013201420152016201720182019202020212022Job postings by U.S. employers4.35.86.8201320232033\n266%Data Scientists and Data Analysts242%Cybersecurity Analysts and Engineers180%Software Developers and Engineers164%Web Designers and UI/UX159%Web Developers132%Software QA and Testers99%CIOs and IT Directors49%Database Architects39%Systems Analysts and Engineers22%Network Support Specialists21%IT Support SpecialistsHiring activity to offset turnover\nSource: Lightcast | U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | CompTIA Copyright \u00a9 2023 CompTIA | CompTIA.org | Cyberstates.org | State of the Tech Workforce | Page 8$0K$25K$50K$75K$100K$125K$150K$175K$200K$225K$0K$25K$50K$75K$100K$125K$150K$175K\n10th p er-centile25th p er-centile50th(median)75th p er-centile90th p er-centileNational W age Perc entilesTech Wa ge PercentilesTHE MANY FACETS OF WAGE DATAANNUAL WAGE COMPARISON ACROSS OCCUPATIONSKEY POINTS\u21e5There are many nuances to the tech wage discussion. At the industry level \u2013 meaning the universe of technology companies in the sector, wages encompass all staff positions, from the CEO down to entry-level helpdesk workers. Both technical and non-technical positions factor into the industry wage calculation. Because of the diversity of positions covered, interpreting summary industry wage data requires accounting for these factors. In comparison, tech occupation wages cover only technical positions. This is the primary focus of the wage data of this report.\u21e5Cost of living differences mean the wages in one location are not directly comparable to another. For example, the buying power of a salary in San Francisco will not go nearly as far as in Des Moines. According to the National Association of Realtors, the median price for a home in Silicon Valley exceeds $1.2 million. See CompTIA IT Salary Calculator for detailed wage data across 400+ metro areas.\u21e5Beyond location, the other important variables to consider when reviewing wage data are job role, areas of expertise, job experience, industry sector, and company size. A skilled employee in a hot field such as artificial intelligence, working for a Fortune 500 company, will earn on average far more than a tech worker in an established field, working for a small business in a rural area. \u21e5Percentiles help provide insight into wage ranges. This approach minimizes the impact of outlier data points, such as workers receiving massive stock payouts. It is also useful in depicting wages along common career paths, with workers just starting out earning wages at the 10th percentile, and then with experience and additional training and certification, moving up through the higher wage levels.\u21e5Across all tech occupation categories covered in this report, the median wage, also referred to as the 50th percentile or midpoint, was an estimated $104,406 in 2022, the most recent year of available government data. This figure is more than double the median wage across all occupations of the U.S. labor force. Note: sources such as Glassdoor may provide more real-time data but the tradeoff is a higher degree of data uncertainty than data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\u21e5The scatterplot graph to the right illustrates the degree to which wages will differ across states. The data presents wages for software developers and IT support specialists across percentiles. Tenth and 25th percentiles often correspond to early-stage career positions (e.g. 0-4 years of experience), while 75th and 90th percentiles cover higher-end experience and expertise.\u21e5When drilling down to the metro area level, wage differences may become even more pronounced. Top tier wages in locations such as San Jose or New York City may run into hundreds of thousands, if not more when factoring in bonuses or stock options.TECH WAGES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BASED ON OCCUPATION, LOCATION, AND PERCENTILE\n75th percentile90th percentile10th percentile25th percentile130% higher\nWage percentile examples for Software Developers and IT Support Specialists \nWages in the same tech job can vary widely\nSource: Lightcast | U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | CompTIA Copyright \u00a9 2023 CompTIA | CompTIA.org | Cyberstates.org | State of the Tech Workforce | Page 9LABOR FORCE CHARACTERISTICS OVERVIEW\u21e5The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks labor market composition across several demographic and firmographic characteristics. By race and ethnicity, the BLS segments data by seven top-level categorizations. Described in detail here:\u21e5Additional population segmentations are available from the Census Bureau, but for the purposes of analyzing labor market compositions of specific occupation categories, the seven categories above are the extent of data availability.  DIVERSITY INDEX\u21e5There are several approaches to assessing labor force characteristics. Numeric totals and relative percentages are good starting points. Taking it a step further, however, provides deeper insights and more context.\u21e5To measure overall race and ethnicity characteristics within the tech workforce, this report uses a metric called Simpson's Diversity Index. This index weights two key facets of  race and ethnicity within the workforce \u2013 richness and evenness (or think of it as depth and breadth) and reflects it in a single metric.\u21e5The U.S. tech workforce recorded a Diversity Index measure of 59, roughly on par with the overall U.S. workforce measure of 57 on a 100-point scale. The District of Columbia recorded the highest tech workforce Diversity Index score at 68, followed by Texas, California, and Georgia. In contrast, the states at the other end of the continuum had tech workforce Diversity Index scores below 20.TECH WORKFORCE REPRESENTATION\u21e5As the name implies, tech workforce representation measures the composition of the tech workforce relative to the overall composition across all occupations.\u21e5Nationally, Black or African American workers represent 12% of the U.S. workforce and 8% of tech occupations. This gap signals underrepresentation in the tech workforce. Examples of states with high levels of tech workforce representation numerically and in relation to the overall workforce composition include the District of Columbia, Mississippi, Georgia, and Maryland.\u21e5Nationally, Hispanic or Latino workers represent 17% of the U.S. workforce and 8% of tech occupations. This gap signals underrepresentation in the tech workforce. Examples of states with high levels of tech workforce representation numerically and in relation to the overall workforce composition include New Mexico, Florida, Texas, and Arizona.\u21e5Nationally, women represent approximately 49% of the U.S. workforce and 26% of tech occupations. This gap signals underrepresentation in the tech workforce. Examples of states with high levels of tech workforce representation in relation to the overall workforce composition include the District of Columbia, Mississippi, Maine, and South Carolina.KEY FINDINGS \u2013 TECH WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS 8%\nvs. representation across all U.S. occupations  Black or African American8%Hispanic or Latino26%Women12%17%49%TECH WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICSU.S. tech occupation representation \nEXAMPLES OF TECH JOB REPRESENTATIONVS.

Net tech employment is projected to grow at an estimated 3.0% year-over-year reaching 9.4 million in 2023. \u21e5Net tech employment accounted for approximately 5.8% of the overall U.S. workforce in 2022. As noted previously, because of the blurring of lines across industries, there is a degree of undercounting in tech sector employment.U.S. TECH INDUSTRY EMPLOYMENT\u21e5U.S. tech industry employment totaled an estimated 6.1 million in 2022, an increase of 199,147 workers from 5.9 million in 2021. Tech industry employment is projected to grow at an estimated 3.2% year-over-year reaching 6.3 million in 2023. As noted, tech industry employment is a subset of net tech employment.\u21e5Tech manufacturing employment totaled an estimated 1.1 million in 2022 and is projected to grow by 13,345 jobs in 2023. \u21e5Among the seven major tech manufacturing subsectors \u2013 the OEMs and companies producing computing hardware, peripherals, semiconductors, etc., one is projected to experience employment losses, while the remaining categories are projected to experience job gains. \u21e5Employment in the telecommunications and Internet services sector totaled an estimated 1.5 million in 2022, projected to go up by 39,553 jobs in 2023. These employment gains are driven by growth in the data processing, hosting, and search portal services categories, where employment should increase by 45,277 jobs. Wired and wireless telecommunications services are projected to lose 8,669 jobs for the same time period.\u21e5The software category, consisting of general purpose software that is not custom developed, also known as published or packaged software products (including SaaS),  employed an estimated 596,343 workers in 2022, and is projected to add more than 28,000 net new jobs. On a percent change basis, software will lead the tech sector with a 4.7% projected year-over-year growth rate.\u21e5The IT services and custom software services subsector will generate the largest numerical gain in employment, adding nearly 114,300 net-new jobs in 2023. This gain of 3.9% will increase the employment base to 3.04 million. This growth reflects the ongoing digital transformations occurring across the economy and the corresponding need for expertise in areas such as cloud computing migration, application integration, process automation, data analytics, and cybersecurity.U.S. TECH OCCUPATION EMPLOYMENT\u21e5Tech occupation jobs reached an estimated 5.6 million workers in 2022 and is projected to increase by 187,542 jobs in 2023. On a percent change basis, the annual growth rate is 3.4%. \u21e5Since 2017, more than 680,000 new tech occupation jobs were added, a function of the demand for tech talent across every industry sector in the economy.\u21e5On a numeric basis, software developers, systems analysts and cybersecurity analysts, network architects, and IT support specialists recorded the largest gains in employment. While the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not yet break out many emerging tech roles, other data sources indicate these new specialties are starting to make meaningful contributions to the growth of the tech workforce.

All states are projected to generate positive tech employment job growth in 2022. While the largest job gains are associated with the states with a significant tech presence, the fact that most states experienced tech employment job gains speaks to the continued broad-based impact of technology across the nation. \u21e5On an industry sector basis, the IT services/custom software services sector has been the growth engine for the greatest number of states over the past year. Year-over-year distribution of counts of top categories by state:\u21e5IT services/custom software services: 49 states\u21e5Software: 48 states\u21e5Telecommunications: 43 states\u21e5Tech manufacturing: 37 states\u21e5The metrics used to provide context and insight into the data tend to be based on absolute size or are relative, which may involve percent change or account for factors such as population or economic size differences. Absolute measures tend to be highly correlated with the size of the state or metro area. For example, California is the largest state in the nation by a wide margin. Its population is 40% larger and its economy is 54% larger than second place Texas. California's economy is equal to the combined total of the bottom 25 states. Unsurprisingly, California is the leader in many State of the Tech Workforce categories.\u21e5California's net tech employment was an estimated 1,487,864 workers in 2022, a gain of 38,186 net new jobs year-over-year. Other states that experienced notable tech employment gains include Texas, New York, Florida, and Virginia. \u21e5On a percent change basis, the top five states for job growth in 2022 were Nevada (+6.4%), Tennessee (+6.2%), Texas (+5.5%), Washington (+5.5%), and Wyoming (+5.0%).\u21e5Employment concentration is a relative metric that compares tech employment to the overall base of employment within a state. Sixteen states are at a higher rate than the national average of 5.8%.\u21e5Washington has the highest concentration (9.4%) of tech workers relative to its overall employment base, which means citizens of the state are more likely to hold a tech job relative to other industry sectors.

These could be startups launching a new tech venture or established tech firms expanding operations with another business unit (e.g. opening a new business establishment in another state). Nationally, the count of tech business establishments increased 7.5% in 2022, or the equivalent of 40,507 additional business establishments.  \u21e5On a numeric basis, Florida had the largest year-over-year increase of net-new tech business establishments (+2,733). Rounding out the top five for net-new tech business establishments were Texas, North Carolina, Illinois, and Colorado. On a percent change basis, Wyoming experienced the largest increase at 15.7%, followed by South Dakota, North Dakota, Vermont, and Tennessee. STATE TECH ECONOMIC IMPACT\u21e5Economic impact is an assessment of output \u2013 the dollar value of goods and services produced during a given year (also referred to as gross domestic or regional product). As a percentage of the overall U.S. economy, the tech industry accounts for 8.8% of direct economic value, which translates to over $1.97 trillion.\u21e5A total of 29 states have a tech sector that generates $10 billion or more in direct economic impact to the state. California tops the list at a massive $535.9 billion in economic impact, representing 16.7% of the state's economy. On a dollar basis the other top states include Texas, New York, Washington, and Massachusetts. \u21e5In addition to the direct economic impact, there are downstream, indirect benefits of the technology industry. One way to assess this impact is the use of job multiplier metrics, also referred to as input-output modeling. For example, the IT services and custom software development services category has an estimated jobs multiplier of 4.8. For every one job in this tech subsector, an estimated 4.8 additional jobs are created or supported through direct, indirect, or induced means.STATE EMPLOYER JOB POSTINGS\u21e5On volume basis the top states for employer hiring activity via tech job postings in 2022 were California, Texas, Florida, and New York. States that saw the greatest increase year-over-year were California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, and Virginia.\u21e5Top states for emerging tech job postings in 2022 were California (186,418), Texas (113,629), New York (60,684), Virginia (57,316), and Illinois (54,895). States that saw the largest increase in emerging tech positions in 2022 when compared to the previous year were California (+19,023), Texas (+12,665), and Illinois (+11,505). \u21e5Emerging tech job postings as a percentage of total tech job postings are highest in Washington (42.7% of IT Job postings are emerging tech), Massachusetts (39.5%), South Dakota (38.9%), Delaware (34.4%), and Tennessee (34.3%). THE WORK FROM HOME (WFH) IMPACT\u21e5The job posting data confirms a momentous shift in thinking about work location among employer and employees. Among all tech job postings in 2022, 34% specified a WFH or hybrid work option, or slightly over 1.4 million job postings. This represents a 146% increase over the 2019 pre-pandemic rate.

It follows that it also has the largest base of tech employment.\u21e5Silicon Valley continues to be a critically important hub for innovation. Between San Francisco and San Jose, there are a little more than 700,000 tech industry and tech occupation workers. The discussion doesn't end there, however, as technology increasingly has a significant presence across the nation. Cities such as Boston, Seattle, New York, Dallas, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Denver and more, boast sizable tech workforces and notable job gain rates. This includes the sometimes \"under the radar\" tech cities of Austin, Raleigh, Charlotte, Phoenix, Detroit, Orlando, and more. METRO AREA EMPLOYMENT CONCENTRATION\u21e5Employment concentration provides a measure of tech employment relative to employment across all the other industry sectors in a local economy. Along with economic impact as a percentage of a local economy, these metrics help to put tech into context. \u21e5At 31.3%, San Jose has the highest concentration of net tech employment as a percentage of its overall employment base. \u21e5Compared to the national tech employment concentration benchmark of 5.8%, 25 metro areas had the same rate or higher, confirming the importance of technology to a far-reaching set of cities across the country.  METRO AREA TECH BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS\u21e5A large, dynamic base of business establishments, also referred to as company locations, is another measure of a healthy tech sector. The New York City metro area is home to 23,149 tech business establishments. Other top cities are Washington DC, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Seattle. \u21e5The vast majority of tech business establishments are categorized as small businesses under the Small Business Administration's definition of up to 500 employees. \u21e5Outside of the top five, the next largest metropolitan areas for the number of tech sector business establishments include Denver, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, and Atlanta. METRO AREA EMPLOYER JOB POSTINGS\u21e5Cities with the most tech job postings in 2022 were New York, Washington DC, Dallas, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco. In terms of year over year numerical change, the top 5 metros were New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, and Houston. \u21e5Emerging tech job positions were highest in New York City (78,667), Washington DC (63,469), San Francisco (57,506), Dallas (52,945), and Los Angeles (46,927) round out the top five cities for emerging tech job postings.
