Will conducting interviews with a smaller number of people be enough to drive a content calendar overall or on a specific financial topic? Does it need to be Paven users to be able to inform content? If no and yes (respectively), then don't need funding for UserTesting or dScout.\n\nA: Yes and no. Yes \u2013 interviews with a smaller number of people would be helpful to fine-tune our content calendar. No \u2013 it wouldn't need to be Paven users as long as they meet demographics outlined for our target audience.\n\nBased on above answer, sounds like need funding. Let's discuss next steps to get that funding \u2013 including product goals and priorities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW DRAFT:\n\n\n\nAs we strive to enhance the user experience of Paven, it is crucial to understand the current financial struggles faced by our users. This research will inform the creation of educational articles that resonate with our audience, ultimately increasing engagement and the number of articles read per month.\n\n \n\nObjectives\n\nIdentify User Struggles: Understand the specific financial challenges our users are facing at this time.\n\nContent Relevance: Determine what types of educational content would be most beneficial and engaging for our users.\n\nBehavioral Insights: Explore how users currently engage with financial wellness content and identify barriers to reading more articles.\n\n \n\nExpected Outcomes\n\nA comprehensive understanding of the financial and benefits struggles faced by our users.\n\nInsights into user preferences for educational content that can drive engagement.\n\nRecommendations for content topics and formats that will attract users to read more articles.\n\n \n\nAction Plan\n\nUnderstanding user needs is at the core of our research initiative. By identifying the financial and benefits struggles faced by our users, we can create content that directly addresses their concerns, thereby enhancing their experience with the app. Here's how we can tie the research back to user needs:\n\n \n\nUser-Centric Content Creation: The insights gained from research will allow us to develop articles that resonate with users' real-life challenges. For instance, if users express difficulty in budgeting or understanding benefits, we can create targeted content that provides practical solutions.\n\nPersonalization: By understanding user preferences for content types (e.g., articles, videos, infographics), we can tailor our offerings to meet diverse learning styles and preferences, making the app more engaging and relevant.\n\nEmpowerment Through Knowledge: Addressing user needs by providing actionable insights and resources can empower users to make informed financial decisions, ultimately leading to behavior change and improved financial wellness.\n\n \n\nMeasuring Success\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our research and the subsequent content development, we can implement the following metrics.\n\n \n\nEngagement Metrics:", "Sprints, projected Sprints\n\nDecisions\n\nNext Steps \n\nLinks to scope documents/final reports\n\nKey stakeholder \n\n\n\n\n\nOther items for Research Practice:\n\nResearch to inform prioritization \n\nCOE Behavioral Practice Meeting \u2013 May 15, come up with an agenda with Angie and Leif\n\nNew First Time Experience \n\nChild Free - Segmentation Strategy \n\n??? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Backlog: \n\nGlobal Navigation Testing [recommendation, after interviews IF want in scope to interviews]\n\n30-day financial wellness challenge\n\nFollow-up survey// can ask some questions, including child-free or not [can we know where they filled out the profile, when onboarded to Paven]\n\nPaven Research Community\n\nPaven Poll Learning Goal: Poll response times \n\nPaven Metrics Reporting: research delivers first monthly report", "Paven research proposal\n\nResearch goals\n\nAudience/target market\n\nOperational research questions\n\n\n\n$15k is an annual Qualtrics subscription including ~5k survey responses\n\nTarget 100\n\nInterviews is more expensive, other platform\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct goals \n\nPaven's higher level objectives are to improve the financial wellbeing of employees and increase benefits usage for our client.  \n\nContent is the main way that we deliver this value, and we want to make sure our content calendar/roadmap meets user needs.  The way we measure success on our content is user engagement and conversion.\n\nProduct Goals:\n\n\u00a0Increase the engagement with content by 30%\n\nContent read per user per month - this reflects users choosing to keep reading in a session, or give Paven another shot next time it comes around (push, newsletter, etc.).  Should correlate with CTR on newsletter and Pushes.\n\nBaseline: 1.4 reads/month/user\n\nGoal: 1.92 reads/month/user\n\nIncrease conversion on Suggestions by 30% (user takes next steps after reading the\ncontent)\n\ta. Suggestion clicks per user per month - this could include benefits external\n\tlinks or just reading more articles. This reflects the effectiveness of the article to convince someone to take the next step, or that it's worth reading on.\n\nb. Baseline:\n\nc. Goal:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we need to know?\n\nWe need to know what topics to include in our content calendar for 1H25, so that we can create content that is more engaging and leads to more conversions.\n\nWe don't want to limit potential topics that come up in research; Later, we can do a mapping of the topics from research to Paven's capabilities and the client needs.\n\nOutput: \n\nlist of topics, with relative popularity and maybe some insights/quotes as to the deeper why on the topic.\n\nBelow are some examples of areas to explore.  \n\nWhat specific financial topics are most interesting right now? \n\nWe know that the \"financial lifestyle\" type articles have done well in the past. Are there other specialty topics/themes like that that users would be interested in?\n\nWhat concerns do they have about financial topics right now? What about those topics are most concerning? What would help them feel more confident about those topics? Topics may be: \n\nThe economy\n\nInterest rates\n\nHousing market trends\n\nHow anxious (or confident) are you about your personal finances lately? Could ask that question about each of: Budgeting, Saving for Retirement, Saving for big costs or other life goals \n\nWhat parts do you most worry about? What keeps you up at night? \n\nIn what areas do you feel like you're behind or stuck \n\nInternal stuff like managing debt, saving for retirement, and others \n\nExternal factors like: the economy, interest rates, housing market, etc\n\nThen ask similar questions probing how they feel about taking advantage of their benefits?\n\nWhat financial topics are they interested in learning about but don't even know how to start? Such as:\n\nInvesting and playing the stock market\n\nCrypto\n\nDebt consolidation", "Engagement Metrics:\n\nArticle Read Rate: Track the number of articles read per user per month before and after implementing the new content strategy.\n\nBaseline: 2H24, from 2500 active users:\n\n54%: 1354 did not read any article\n\n13%: 328 read only 1 article\n\n33%; 818 read more than 1\n\nGoal: 1H25, from active users:\n\n25%: did not read any article\n\n25%: read only 1 article\n\n50%: read more than 1\n\nTime Spent on Articles: Measure the average time users spend reading articles, indicating engagement and interest in the content.\n\nBaseline: XX time/month/user\n\nGoal: XX time/month/user\n\n \n\nUser Feedback:\n\nSurveys and Polls: Conduct follow-up surveys to assess user satisfaction with the new content and its relevance to their financial needs.\n\n \n\nBehavioral Changes:\n\nTracking Behavior Change: Monitor any changes in user behavior related to financial wellness, such as increased usage of goal tracking, budgeting tool or benefit utilization, as a result of engaging with the content.\n\n \n\nRetention Rates:\n\nUser Retention: Analyze user retention rates over time to see if improved content leads to higher retention and reduced churn.\n\n \n\nContent Performance:\n\nArticle Performance Metrics: Evaluate which articles perform best in terms of views, shares, and user interactions to refine future content strategies.\n\n \n\nBy aligning our research efforts with user needs and establishing clear metrics for success, we can create a more impactful app experience that not only attracts users but also fosters meaningful behavior change in financial wellness.", "Hello Paven team,\n\n\n\nHere is Haila and I's weekly research update.

An increase in contributions to retirement plans or \nenrollment in health savings accounts (HSAs) may signify that the financial wellness program is assisting \nemployees in identifying opportunities to save and invest for the future. Enhanced participation in \nemployer -sponsored life, disability, and other safety net coverages can also serve as positive indicators.\n3.Reduced Financial Hardships: Examine payroll and retirement plan data for downward trends in \noutstanding 401(k) loans, instances of 401(k) hardship withdrawals, loan defaults, and the use of \nemergency or payday loans. A decrease in financial hardships may indicate progress in improving \nfinancial wellness.\n4.Impact on Absenteeism, Productivity, and Healthcare Costs: Evaluate the impact of financial \nwellness on reducing employee stress by monitoring absenteeism rates, as well as data related to \ndisability and worker's compensation claims, and health benefit claims associated with stress -related \nillnesses.\n5.Employee Feedback: The most direct method for assessing the effectiveness of financial wellness \nprogram is to solicit feedback from employees.

Will conducting interviews with a smaller number of people be enough to drive a content calendar overall or on a specific financial topic? Does it need to be Paven users to be able to inform content? If no and yes (respectively), then don't need funding for UserTesting or dScout.\n\nA: Yes and no. Yes \u2013 interviews with a smaller number of people would be helpful to fine-tune our content calendar. No \u2013 it wouldn't need to be Paven users as long as they meet demographics outlined for our target audience.\n\nBased on above answer, sounds like need funding. Let's discuss next steps to get that funding \u2013 including product goals and priorities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW DRAFT:\n\n\n\nAs we strive to enhance the user experience of Paven, it is crucial to understand the current financial struggles faced by our users. This research will inform the creation of educational articles that resonate with our audience, ultimately increasing engagement and the number of articles read per month.\n\n \n\nObjectives\n\nIdentify User Struggles: Understand the specific financial challenges our users are facing at this time.\n\nContent Relevance: Determine what types of educational content would be most beneficial and engaging for our users.\n\nBehavioral Insights: Explore how users currently engage with financial wellness content and identify barriers to reading more articles.\n\n \n\nExpected Outcomes\n\nA comprehensive understanding of the financial and benefits struggles faced by our users.\n\nInsights into user preferences for educational content that can drive engagement.\n\nRecommendations for content topics and formats that will attract users to read more articles.\n\n \n\nAction Plan\n\nUnderstanding user needs is at the core of our research initiative. By identifying the financial and benefits struggles faced by our users, we can create content that directly addresses their concerns, thereby enhancing their experience with the app. Here's how we can tie the research back to user needs:\n\n \n\nUser-Centric Content Creation: The insights gained from research will allow us to develop articles that resonate with users' real-life challenges. For instance, if users express difficulty in budgeting or understanding benefits, we can create targeted content that provides practical solutions.\n\nPersonalization: By understanding user preferences for content types (e.g., articles, videos, infographics), we can tailor our offerings to meet diverse learning styles and preferences, making the app more engaging and relevant.\n\nEmpowerment Through Knowledge: Addressing user needs by providing actionable insights and resources can empower users to make informed financial decisions, ultimately leading to behavior change and improved financial wellness.\n\n \n\nMeasuring Success\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our research and the subsequent content development, we can implement the following metrics.\n\n \n\nEngagement Metrics:", "Sprints, projected Sprints\n\nDecisions\n\nNext Steps \n\nLinks to scope documents/final reports\n\nKey stakeholder \n\n\n\n\n\nOther items for Research Practice:\n\nResearch to inform prioritization \n\nCOE Behavioral Practice Meeting \u2013 May 15, come up with an agenda with Angie and Leif\n\nNew First Time Experience \n\nChild Free - Segmentation Strategy \n\n??? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Backlog: \n\nGlobal Navigation Testing [recommendation, after interviews IF want in scope to interviews]\n\n30-day financial wellness challenge\n\nFollow-up survey// can ask some questions, including child-free or not [can we know where they filled out the profile, when onboarded to Paven]\n\nPaven Research Community\n\nPaven Poll Learning Goal: Poll response times \n\nPaven Metrics Reporting: research delivers first monthly report", "Engagement Metrics:\n\nArticle Read Rate: Track the number of articles read per user per month before and after implementing the new content strategy.\n\nBaseline: 2H24, from 2500 active users:\n\n54%: 1354 did not read any article\n\n13%: 328 read only 1 article\n\n33%; 818 read more than 1\n\nGoal: 1H25, from active users:\n\n25%: did not read any article\n\n25%: read only 1 article\n\n50%: read more than 1\n\nTime Spent on Articles: Measure the average time users spend reading articles, indicating engagement and interest in the content.\n\nBaseline: XX time/month/user\n\nGoal: XX time/month/user\n\n \n\nUser Feedback:\n\nSurveys and Polls: Conduct follow-up surveys to assess user satisfaction with the new content and its relevance to their financial needs.\n\n \n\nBehavioral Changes:\n\nTracking Behavior Change: Monitor any changes in user behavior related to financial wellness, such as increased usage of goal tracking, budgeting tool or benefit utilization, as a result of engaging with the content.\n\n \n\nRetention Rates:\n\nUser Retention: Analyze user retention rates over time to see if improved content leads to higher retention and reduced churn.\n\n \n\nContent Performance:\n\nArticle Performance Metrics: Evaluate which articles perform best in terms of views, shares, and user interactions to refine future content strategies.\n\n \n\nBy aligning our research efforts with user needs and establishing clear metrics for success, we can create a more impactful app experience that not only attracts users but also fosters meaningful behavior change in financial wellness.", "Hello Paven team,\n\n\n\nThis is Haila and Scotty's first weekly research update!

The information they provide to us via poll questions is a strategic input for:\n\nMaking decisions about our roadmap\n\nIdentifying content and feature gaps\n\nUnderstanding our users in general\n\n\n\nPolls also provide opportunities for increased engagement by giving users an active role through reading the poll content and answering the questions. \n\n\n\nUser value\n\nBy interacting with polls, users get the following benefits:\n\nAwareness and reflection: When taking a poll, users must pause to think about their answer, which inspires reflection and awareness, key factors for behavior change. \n\nCommunity bonding: When users answer a poll question, they can see the percentage of users who answered for all choices, which provides a sense of community and comradery.\n\nDesirable content: Through poll data analysis, we can identify content needs and gaps. Then, we can publish new content, knowing users are already interested in the topic.\n\n\n\nMetrics impacted\n\n# of users who take the poll\n\n# of articles inspired by polls\n\n# of features inspired by polls\n\n# of suggestion redirects from polls\n\nBackground\n\nPolls were developed for Paven with a different strategy than how we're using them now. Originally, a poll was a single-question interaction following an article. The purpose was to test the user's knowledge or mindset after reading a specific topic. Now, we're using polls as a strategic research asset to inspire our content calendar, identify gaps in topics or features, and gather user insights.\n\n\n\nHowever, our potential for additional ROI is limited by the current format and functionality of polls. We can only present multiple-choice questions with a maximum of 4 answer options. We'd like the ability to present different types of questions and answer inputs along with a way to collect interest in initiatives (like a 30-day challenge or research panel).\n\n\n\nOther important considerations\n\nThe CMS architecture for publishing polls is complex and time-consuming. There are also bugs that affect the display of polls for some users/platforms. (There doesn't seem to be consistent experience between Android, web, iPhone. If you fix one, the other breaks.) The team often spends more than half a day working within the CMS and tweaking the backend to get Paven polls to work as intended.\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements (feature-level)\n\nView features and
